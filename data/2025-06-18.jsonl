Natural language processing\ntechnologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely\napplied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information\nsupport for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model\nperformance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related\ninstruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains\ninadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction\ndata for climate change, which limits further development of climate change\nLLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction\ndata. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge\nfrom documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web\nscraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we\nconstructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus,\nwhich was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named\nClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves\nperformance on climate change question-and-answer tasks.

However, the dataset\nexhibits class imbalance, which leads to notably poor model performance\nparticularly when segmenting fine-grained classes such as cracks and cavities.\nThis work introduces \"synth-dacl\", a compilation of three novel dataset\nextensions based on synthetic concrete textures. These extensions are designed\nto balance class distribution in dacl10k and enhance model performance,\nespecially for crack and cavity segmentation. When incorporating the synth-dacl\nextensions, we observe substantial improvements in model robustness across 15\nperturbed test sets. Notably, on the perturbed test set, a model trained on\ndacl10k combined with all synthetic extensions achieves a 2% increase in mean\nIoU, F1 score, Recall, and Precision compared to the same model trained solely\non dacl10k."}

Due to their linguistic capacities, it\nis possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual\ncoding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different\nLLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using\nGerman data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate\nthe LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance\ndiffers greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory\nlevels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting\napproaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal\nclassification performance across different categories of reasons for survey\nparticipation results in different categorical distributions when not using\nfine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for\nmethodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their\nsubstantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively\nanalyzing such data.

A lifelike talking head\nrequires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial\nexpressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a\nfundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue\nof synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking\nheads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with\nGaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a\nFace-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively\nusing a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions.\nTo ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which\noptimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances\nrobustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression\nGenerator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial\nexpressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and\ncontinuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering\nspeed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second. Extensive experiments\nand user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk++ outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in synchronization and realism.

In this work, we seek to\noptimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to\nallow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its\ncomplexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate\ntext-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of\ndenoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image\nmodel. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model\nquantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to\nreserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex\nprompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for\nless sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB\nthat by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our\napproach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that\nachievable by any of these models alone."}

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain\nEO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient\nfine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data.\nIn this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation\nModel, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which\ncovers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized\nsubset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study\nvarious PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and\narchitectures. Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road\ndensity estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover\nsemantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate\nthat for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB\nmodel outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots\nfor road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M\nFastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and\nmodel scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of\narchitecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT)."}

They\nover-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods\nlike Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding\n(ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions\nfrom perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this\nwork, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal\nattention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their\neffectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits\nbut from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we\npropose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly\nintervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled\napproach to mitigating hallucinations.

These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from\nexpert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp\nplanning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods.
