If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform.

Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations\noutperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the\nimportance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic\ndiagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's\ninternal understanding of the world."}

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling.

The MGCA module performs initial attention-based\nfusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask\nsemantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated\nattention driven by text semantics.

Precise pose estimation is particularly important\nfor upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on\nautonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To\nhelp overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an\napproach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for\nzero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment\ndetections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,\nwhich is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a\nprevious session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables\naccurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.\nLunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization\nexperiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global\nlocalization. To encourage the development of further methods for global\nlocalization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback\nmodule: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data."}

To\ndemonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides\ntimestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges\nspecializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding\nwindows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,\ngenerating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this\nlanguage-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match\nevents, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional\nvideo-based methods for action spotting."}

Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:\nunderstanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment\nacross network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better\ncomprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality\nalignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to\nrecover spatial details.

Recent attempts train VLMs\nto render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often\nhinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental\nimagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we\ninvestigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories\nwithout producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental\nImagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent\nvisual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses\nto ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby\ncontinuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images.
