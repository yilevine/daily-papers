If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform.

Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,\nincorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across\nboth word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation\nbudget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.\n  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and\nsix model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound\nperturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance\ndegradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations\noutperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the\nimportance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic\ndiagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's\ninternal understanding of the world."}

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment.

Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models.

The SIG generates mask and text semantics\nbased on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based\nfusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask\nsemantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated\nattention driven by text semantics.

Our key insight to\novercome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really\nmatters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on\nidentifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative\narchitecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize\na specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative\narchitectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are\nunbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models.

In this work, we propose a shift from this\nvideo-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable\nby utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained\ndescriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,\ncontains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To\ndemonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides\ntimestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges\nspecializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding\nwindows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,\ngenerating accurate timestamps for these events.

Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:\nunderstanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment\nacross network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better\ncomprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality\nalignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to\nrecover spatial details.

Recent attempts train VLMs\nto render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often\nhinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental\nimagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we\ninvestigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories\nwithout producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental\nImagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent\nvisual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses\nto ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby\ncontinuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin\nby supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image\nembeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent\ntrajectory align tightly with the task objective.
