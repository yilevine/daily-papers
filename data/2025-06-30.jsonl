Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region.

While multimodal approaches\nintegrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the\ncomprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial\ntranscriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular\nheterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining.

SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,\nwhere experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive\nlearning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene\nexpression profiles.

RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer.

Masked point modeling-based methods have\nrecently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These\npre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the\nperception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which\nleads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the\nself-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked\nAutoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component\nsemantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.\nSpecifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component\nsemantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in\ncapturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these\nprototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that\naddresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete\ncomponent structures.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed.

Each modality expert then undergoes specialized\nsingle-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.\nAs a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the\noriginal LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of\nover 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par\nwith modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within\n0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk."}

To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control.

In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results.

Notable linguistic patterns in\nMT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative\nconjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%\nclassification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and\nNMTs using more brackets.

In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at\ngenerates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial\nconfiguration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on\nscene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To\naddress this question, we introduce the \\textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context\n(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to\nobjects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different\nperturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,\ndepending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the\nlevel of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high\ntarget-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis\nreveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the\ntarget in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that\nVLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference\ngeneration.

In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context\ncan strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines\nASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually\nrelevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with\nstrengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric\nspecifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method\nin enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs."}
