Recently, the trend for this task has\nbeen to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts\nautomatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based\nmethods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes\nand design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout\ngeneration. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that\nleverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent\nlayouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we\nenhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such\nas region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing\nthe layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling\nthe generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined\nrelationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines\nlayout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct\nlayout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that\narise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive\nexperimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can\ngenerate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human\naesthetics and more explainable."}

However, because data from different modalities are\ntypically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental\nconditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution\ndiscrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.\nFurthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater\nchallenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space.

We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion\nmodel for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,\nthe complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into\nlow- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and\nboundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then\ndesigned to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.\nDuring the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is\nutilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.\nFurthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are\njointly learned to further boost classification accuracy.

However, these\ndatasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving\nthe impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or\ndepth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate\nsuch variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our\ndataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater\nperformance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance\ncomparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data\nquantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is\neffective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even\ngreater improvements.

Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion\nstrategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge\ninto the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation\nbetween the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a\nreward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss\nfor model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead\nof pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the\ngenerated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the\ngenerated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and\nshowcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization\ncapabilities.

On well-structured domains such as\nvector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential\ngeometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with\nstrong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a\ncarefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most\npractitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing\nlayers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this\ngap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general\nsimilarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized\ninto diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from\nLaplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural\nbehavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing\nand processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or\nmixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate\nheat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,\nwith applications to shape analysis and matching."}

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.
