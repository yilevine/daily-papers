This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings\nhighlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the\npotential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering\na more informed online space."}

Between-person effects revealed an average\nnegative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the\npost level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social\napproval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on\nniche social media platforms."}

When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels.

To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system.

To address these limitations, we\npropose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for\nlanguage-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance.

However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset.

The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI.

We thus propose a novel\n5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an\nEEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and\ntext embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,\n(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer\nsemantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.\nWe enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment\nand re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates\nhigh-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches\nby 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and\nreducing Fr\\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic\nalignment and image quality."}

First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,\nwhich limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,\nwhich employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with\ndecoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables\nfine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the\ngeneration of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in\ndiscrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first\nconsistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability\nto maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of\nlatest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,\nbroadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios.

To facilitate interactive and\nreal-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer\nthat shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We\nexplore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer\narchitecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal\ncausal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to\nenable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle\nreal-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information\nwhile maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we\npropose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry\ngrounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model\nsupports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,\nFlashAttention) from the field of large language models.

Traditional methods relying on\nhardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,\nand environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world\nscenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising\nalternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to\neither the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific\nand small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models\nin other domains has inspired the development of \"depth foundation models\":\ndeep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning\narchitectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,\nmulti-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these\nmodels to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of\nlarge-scale datasets that can facilitate their development.
