To address\nthese challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework\ndesigned to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving\ndetection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:\nFrequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which\nrefines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency\nfiltering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive\nHierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively\nintegrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen\nhierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,\nand Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation\ncapabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while\nreducing model complexity.

Existing construction\nmethods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual\nintervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,\nthey struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces\nsuitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce\nAortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces\ndirectly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided\nconditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines\nconditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then\nautomatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,\nensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are\nfitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh\nrepresentation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,\nincluding an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,\nand the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric\nfidelity.

To address this, we\nintroduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately\nreconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM\nscans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and\nexperimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow\nimplementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to\ncollect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)\nour SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that\nrequires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).\nSparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in\nMoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of\ncrystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks.

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

We introduce\nDiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit\nstatic-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static\ntoken from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing\nstatic content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates\nthree key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a\ntime-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing\nstatic information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention\nthat routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens\nframe-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual\nstatic-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using\nswap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest\nswap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic\ntransfer, and reduces average cross-leakage."}
