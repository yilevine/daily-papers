Among these\napplications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built\nenvironment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed\nimagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from\nsatellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of\nhigh-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture\nthe built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable\nadvancements in object detection and representation using visual data,\nprimitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in\ncomputer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on\nlabor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep\nlearning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address\nthese challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach\nenhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building\nboundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and\nembedding Attraction Field Maps into the network.

It is important to explore whether we can learn a\nuniversal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this\nwork, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of\nexposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic\nrange (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from\npublic sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure\nsequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via\nmulti-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from\na single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated\nMES into an enhanced image.

Our\nmethod recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable\nreasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format\noptimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This\nenables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic\nwhile simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority.

Yet, connecting these\nasynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce\nTalk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object\ngrounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we\nprovide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four\ngrounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to\nother objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully\nexploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding\nframework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a\nMixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different\nmodalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope\nour dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,\ntemporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and\nautonomy."}

However, existing datasets\nand methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other\nautonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,\nthe first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations\ncollected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby\nfacilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well\nas cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel\ncross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the\nwell-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves\nperspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric\nand feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the\nresilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,\nproviding valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging\ncross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation\nmethods.

Their remarkable performance in\nunderstanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks\n(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited\nvocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being\nnon-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models\n(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.\nThis is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception\nsystems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case\nsituation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to\neither potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who\nare present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in\nreality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving\nsystems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous\ndecisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the\nperformance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic\nsituations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for\ncapturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe\nthat both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding\ncapabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult\nto spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements\nin their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such\nas BetterCheck that we propose in our work."}

To achieve this high-fidelity\nand interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,\nwhich consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,\nvideo generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,\nwe quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction\nusing keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion\nTransformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an\nautoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)\nand Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)\nare introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise\ncontrol. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic\noptimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms.

In this work, we propose\nUltra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates\nsparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the\ncompact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in\nthe first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate\nprediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we\nintroduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that\nrestricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.\nThis design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global\nattention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this\nmechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw\nmeshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nUltra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference."}
