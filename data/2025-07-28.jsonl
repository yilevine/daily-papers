However, existing benchmarks for\nreproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using\nprovided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)\noversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data\nformats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce\nREPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social\nscience paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are\ntasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original\npaper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features\nend-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers\nwith complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three\nrepresentative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent\nachieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we\ndevelop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing\nagents by 71%.

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse\nfinite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate\nsurrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in\nthe future."}

For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points.

However, existing VOS models often struggle with\nprecise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming\nobjects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public\ndatasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method\nconsistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,\nHQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its\neffectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object\ndynamics over extended temporal durations."}

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved.

We introduce BEV-LLM,\na lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM\nleverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,\nincorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene\ndescriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves\ncompetitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art\nby up to 5\\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView\n(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on\nobject grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving\nscenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial\nbenchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness."}

However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical\nfindings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep\nlearning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed\nclasses. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image\nPre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the\nlatent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by\nStudent t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered\nembeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the\nfeatures. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\\% points in\nzero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from\nprevious SOTA models."}

While these strategies allow input lengths to\nscale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic\ncomputational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this\npaper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device\nusing generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and\ninference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic\nsingle device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions\n-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between\naccuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE\n(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient\ntransformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse\nmodalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,\nprogressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational\nblocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of\ntokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence\nbecomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE\nachieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to\nexisting long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple\nmodalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision."}

To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results.

To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models.

Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects.
