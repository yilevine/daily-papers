Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of\nimages, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This\npaper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive\ngamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of\nthe low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive\ngamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively\nat different illumination levels suitable for the image without human\nintervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved\nlow-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color\ndistribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a\nmore efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple\napplications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical\nimages, and photography in low-light environments."}

However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these\ndimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one\nsingle modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human\nannotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across\nlanguages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce\nMCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual\nhuman-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to\nevaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both\nshort- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,\nvision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and\nChinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret\ninstructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual\ninformation.

We build on the proposed\nframework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five\nstate-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial\nattributes.

We first estimate a depth map from a source image and\nthen convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural\ncues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs\ninto image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available\nfor network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with\nour synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public\nVOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data\nscarcity problem."}

This model effectively evaluates and filters\npotential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.\nUnlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on\ntop of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent\nevaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates\nthe need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model\nefficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text\nalignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that\ndatasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on\npar with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through\nhigh-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust\nsolution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\\\\n\\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,\ntraining data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely\navailable at https://github.com/daulettoibazar/Compact_VLM_Filter."}

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN).

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses\non events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded\nand use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our\nmethod on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that\noverlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,\nresulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for\nimage reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision\nalgorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth\nestimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\\%$ performance improvement over\nother de-snowing methods.

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the\nfocus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,\nwhich emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid\nadvances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has\nevolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,\nexisting surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical\nstructure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new\nperspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D\nspatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes\n(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene\ncomponents (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction\nof 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene\ncomponents; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.\nWe conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and\nhighlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D\nspatial intelligence.

As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to\ngeneral-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating\ntheir multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short\ncontexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these\ndimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one\nsingle modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human\nannotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across\nlanguages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce\nMCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual\nhuman-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to\nevaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both\nshort- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,\nvision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and\nChinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret\ninstructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual\ninformation. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open\nresearch and progress in MLLMs development."}

While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations\nfrom natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the\nrigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark\ndesigned to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and\ndiverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier\ndetection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a\ndata table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and\nannotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,\nand dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source\nmodels, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,\nand offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose\nthe first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the\ntextual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%\nto 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce\nan automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment\nacross thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer\ncorrectness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart\naccuracy.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data."}
