Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents.

Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality.

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake\ndetection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online\nsynthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to\ngradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between\nsource domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning.

Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The\nclassification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform\nthe baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method\nfor few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning\n(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural\nnetworks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color\nspace and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can\nfacilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For\nsufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on\nfour coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four\ncross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high\naccuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with\none-shot sample per class.

Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through\nautoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such\nas low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex\ninstructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely\nattributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information\nloss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this\nchallenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training\nimage generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with\nautoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate\nartifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete\nautoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image\nand language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a\nunified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline\ndiffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language\nmodel, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong\ncapabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts."}

However, traditional AL methods, developed\nfor images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition\ndue to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These\nmethods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is\nineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the\nentire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active\nlearning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step\nrecognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which\nleverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within\neach video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination\nprioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step\ncompositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets\n(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms\nexisting active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step\nrecognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for\nefficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing\ncomputer-assisted surgical systems."}

Existing FSVOS datasets and methods\ntypically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore\nthe rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios\nrequiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a\nlarge-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on\nMOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different\nrelated tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current\nmethods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the\nassociated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion\nAppearance Network (DMA).
