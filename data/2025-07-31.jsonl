The emergence of\nVietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a\npractical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,\ndomain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark\ndatasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for\nenterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this\ngap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a\ncurated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with\nhuman advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics\nsuch as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa\nprovides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.\nWe further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11\nlightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and\nsyntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic\npatterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance\ndifferences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the\ndevelopment of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and\nsystematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer\nservice QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly\navailable at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/ura-hcmut/Vietnamese-Customer-Support-QA."}

This setup is more flexible and practical than\nconventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks\ndesigned for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique\ncomplexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and\ndiversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored\nspecifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service\nrobots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and\n46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.\nParticipants performed various human actions in diverse environments at\ndistances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,\nsimulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights\ndue to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to\nadvance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we\npropose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long\ndistances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic\nEllipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human\nactions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our\ncode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/wangzy01/ACTIVE-Action-from-Robotic-View."}

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra.
