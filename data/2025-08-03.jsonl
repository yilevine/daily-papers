This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns.

This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence.

Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a\nunified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.\nHowever, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode\nand often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for\nimproved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a\nframework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --\nwithin a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first\ntime in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This\nfine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning\napproach, which captures critical details across modalities for better\nalignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets\nwith synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion\nretrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%\nimprovement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in\nR@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as\nin model robustness to some defenses."}

In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%\naccuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated\nreports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:\n53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the\nlargest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and\nvalidation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,\ngeographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints."}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

For\ntraffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal\nContrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a\nVision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL\nlearns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating\nclass confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method\nachieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for\nall-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,\nsignificantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior\naccuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios."}

However, existing methods often only consider single-relational\ngraphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability\nto fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition\nsentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nMRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on\nmulti-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization.

In the end-to-end model setting, our\nmodel still achieves SOTA results with scores of \\textit{\\textbf{43.2}} on\nScreenSpot-pro and \\textit{\\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the\nvarious details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,\nnot only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other\nperception tasks.

Project Page:\n  https://imnotprepared.github.io/research/25_DSR/", "summary": "We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view\nvideos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of\ncalibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are\nprohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.\nIn contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a\nbike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene\ncoverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that\ndense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view\nsetup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,\nwe carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to\nproduce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive\nexperiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method\nachieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when\nrendering novel views.

To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce\nSUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic\nimages based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33\nbird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific\nconcept, such as wing color or belly pattern.

Direct 4D\ndiffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and\nthe high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and\nmotion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS\nVariation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and\ntheir temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,\nand compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.\nBuilding upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation\nField diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on\ninput videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D\nobjects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation\nquality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable\ngeneralization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on\nsynthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.\nProject page: https://gvfdiffusion.github.io/."}

However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming\nfrom limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and\nreasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which\ncollectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.\nFurthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various\ntypes of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To\naddress the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology\nbenchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'\nhallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary\nclasses: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple\nsubclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning\nrather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase\nframework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case\nStudies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show\nthat our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of\nhallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

However, current\nbenchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal\nreal-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit\nconstraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second\nchallenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and\nspatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to\nseparate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13\nadvanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only\n21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,\nwe observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that\ntraditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.\nOur work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous\nevaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in\nconstraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications."}
