To appear in the AIES Proceedings. 14 pages, 2\n  figures, 2 tables. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0", "summary": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs."}

Secondly, we employ an\nuncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in\nareas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry\ndetails for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce\nhigh-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with\nsmall overlapping views.

Although widely\nresearched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to\nits morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In\nthis contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called\nGHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input\nvectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce\nsemantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of\nthe underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed\nmodel against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from\ntraditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such\nas BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets.

Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more\ntokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU\nmemory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has\nproposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative\ntokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been\ndeveloped to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction\nand its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most\ntraining-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to\ndetermine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a\ntraining-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each\ntoken's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with\nFlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further\ngeneralizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models.

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

However,\nthe substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on\nlarge datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.\nExisting training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model\narchitectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.\nHowever, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where\nmultiple categories are not present in the current test image, and\nvisual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create\nconfusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class\nactivation maps and affinity-refined activation maps.

With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%\nfaster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nPFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.\nFinally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality\nand introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature\nlearning.

Exploring Biometric Verification Scenarios in Photorealistic Talking-Head Avatar Videos", "comment": "Accepted at the IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics\n  (IJCB 2025)", "summary": "Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in\nvirtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more\nimmersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One\nemerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's\navatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to\ndetect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed\nbenchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in\norder to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral\nbiometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems."}

This\npaper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first\nSR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,\nsegmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo\ndropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results\n(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This\nnovel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide\nfield-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The\nmodular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or\npost-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression\nand sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its\nperformance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone\nbased datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance\nevaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial\nMaritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training\ndata, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications."}

In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework\ndesigned to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel\ndual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of\nlearnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to\nadaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)\na label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt\nparameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.\nExtensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that\nPILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and\nlocalization under domain shift."}

Using NIST's Point\nCloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges\nin unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded\nschema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics\non safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:\ngeometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation\nperformance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller\nsafety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is\nimpacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller\nobjects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain\nsafety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified\nchallenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class\nlabels across datasets, and the need for standardization.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.

This paper\nprovides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a\ntaxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time\nstrategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time\nmechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems).
