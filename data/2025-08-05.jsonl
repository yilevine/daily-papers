To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action.

Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments\nconducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in\nenhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small\npedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices."}

Specifically, although linear\nattention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight\ndesign, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence\nmodeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention\ncomputations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the\nnumber of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the\nprocess of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and\ncomputational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature\nmap sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of\nkey sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention\ncomputation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to\nsimulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.\nFinally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines\nit with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.\nThrough visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO\n2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is\ndemonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both\ninference speed and model accuracy.

A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy\nand performance of policies.

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training\nprocess into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage\nand plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism\nvaries across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative\nsamples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn\ndrives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning\nefficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in\nlow-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences.

In\nthis paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection\nEnhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency\nrepresentations. Our contribution is threefold.

In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level.

To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt.

However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

We address\nthis gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed\nusing computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve\ncross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of\na foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across\nmultiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets\ntailored to specific medical modalities.

Existing paradigms are mainly\nconfined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration\nfor physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing\nProjectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:\n1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic\nscene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:\nrestoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce\nan acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose\nestimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively\nschedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman\nfusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to\nmitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in\nreconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic\nmethods."}

In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet\nstrong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data\ncuration for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to\nvarying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.\nAcross extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six\nmedical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly\noutperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,\ncounter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning\ndata provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal\nimage-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on\ntext-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA\nbenchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,\nscaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary\nGPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community\nwith a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical\nreasoning."}

To\naddress this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a\nself-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal\naugmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,\nAugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training\nset, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing\nthe pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy\nsamples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views.

This limits\ntheir utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame\nsequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task\nattempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.
