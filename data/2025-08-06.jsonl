To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters.

To counter these threats,\ndeveloping strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use\nof LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual\nCo-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce\nenvironments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space\ncharacteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the\neffective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations\nshow that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of\nlabeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result\nhighlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data\nis scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to\n128.4 times compared to the baseline models.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP\nestimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations\nrequires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.\nWe validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the\npractical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and\noptimization techniques."}

Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling\nthem to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while\nleaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for\naddressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant\nlimitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional\nimages, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images\nlack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when\nfeatures from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to\ndistinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the\nsame regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery\nDetection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector\n(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift\nCompensation Projection (FS-KDCP).

Real-world data acquisition is\nconstrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while\nexisting synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or\ninconsistencies between bare and makeup images.

In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired\nwith 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality\nbare-makeup image pairs.

The second stage employs\ncomplementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure\nrefinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled\npatches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained\ndetails without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on\nhigh-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and\nprioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries.

Here, we introduce\nSemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual\nhistopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different\nfragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching\ncandidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments\non three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher\nyields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art\nin correct boundary matches."}

However, it faces three core\nchallenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,\ncomplicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB\nappearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;\nand (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic\nLiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and\nLiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional\ndiffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism\n(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and\ndepth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal\nAlignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a\nPanoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency\nacross monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two\nmetrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to\nevaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,\nSemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila\nachieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,\nwhile enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation."}

To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality.

We present Trokens, a\nnovel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational\ntokens for action recognition.

Current benchmarks\noften focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with\nincomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect\nreal-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal\nevaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each\ncomponent within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880\npages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4\ndocument types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data\ncontamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence\npages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.\nOur comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4\nMLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text\nand visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building\nstronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the\nover-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to\nprovide answer even without evidence support.
