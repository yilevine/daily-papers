Despite its advantages,\ndeveloping VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to\nthe time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging\ninstructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs."}

The\neffectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the\npoint sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection\nand removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.\nThis study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)\nalgorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In\nthe proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar\ncoordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard\ndeviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with\nthe global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement\nof industrial washer parts.

These errors are\nparticularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are\nmeasured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods.

We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents.

To address this limitation, we propose\nGPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable\nInterpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the\nperspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.\nThe global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable\nparameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable\nattention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm\nof SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer\nspecifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\nin k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability."}

In this paper, we propose an\nextension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We\nprovide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune\nseveral representation models on this dataset. We call these models\nConcept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models\non various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models\nprovide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach\nbest performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning\nbrings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings."}

Our\nfindings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs\nof communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete\nrecommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech\nresearch."}

Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and\nreinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited\ngeneralization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for\nenhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and\nreasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset\ndependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates\ngrounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object\nlocalization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then\nbuilds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning\naccuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning\npath to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought\n(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby\nreducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.\nFinally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates\nanswer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess\nwhether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our\nexperiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves\nperformance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP\nimproves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by\n4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in\nenhancing reasoning reliability."}

In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations.

BEV\nperception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding\nenvironment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and\ntrajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on\nenhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored\npotential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two\ncontrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining\nBEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image\nbackbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses\nleads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the\nbackbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon\nachieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement\nover state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of\nrepresentation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to\nconventional task-specific optimizations."}

Project website:\n  https://matthew-leng.github.io/stocc", "summary": "3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous\ndriving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,\nit remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across\nmultiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and\ndynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level\noccupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the\nspatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core\ndesigns: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical\ninformation and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and\na memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the\nspatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D\noccupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between\nmulti-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%."}

Salim"], "title": "ZARA: Zero-shot Motion Time-Series Analysis via Knowledge and Retrieval Driven LLM Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),\nwith applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing\nmethods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when\nnew behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language\nmodels (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,\nsuffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose\nZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly\nfrom raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise\nfeature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every\nactivity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,\nand a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select\nfeatures, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and\nnatural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR\nwithout any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA."}

However, concerns\npersist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack\nclinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation\nmetrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first\nlifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical\nbenchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five\ncontinuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive\nchecklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an\nin-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis\nuncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from\nclinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination\nrisks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like\nmodel robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck\nserves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable\nguideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to\nevaluating AI in healthcare."}

However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to\nmultimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory\nmodalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when\ninteracting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce\nthe Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach\nthat encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted\nquestions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the\nmodel to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical\ninformation necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We\nevaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by\nintegrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to\neffectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information.
