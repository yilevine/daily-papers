Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation\nstudies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each\nbranch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components."}

The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection.

Current structured pruning\nmethods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units\nand pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the\ninteraction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the\nfunctionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional\narchitecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.\nInspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and\nfunctional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and\npropose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within\nLLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and\ndecompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional\nbrain networks in neuroimaging data.

In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)\nFamiliarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those\nin the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity\ntraining broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.\n(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.\nTogether, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global\nsensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid\nfast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for\nstudying rapid global context learning in the brain."}

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study.

This\nassumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints\nand static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible\nreconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for\nreconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even\nunder limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the\nscarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis\ndiffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a\nprior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging\nthis insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object\nreconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating\nvisible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction\nmethods.

In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on\nobscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template\nprotection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We\npropose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages\nthe latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize\nprivacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to\nirreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code\nderived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through\na carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric\nrequirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable\nfaces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring\nany modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nFaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing\nsignificantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on\ncommercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods.

When describing actions\nin images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.\ngrooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct\nverb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,\nwhich relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,\nresulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we\npropose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense\nclusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu\ndataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with\neach cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate\nmultiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation\nwith standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis\nsuggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,\noffering a more nuanced assessment of model performance."}
