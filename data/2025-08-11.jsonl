The method combines nested semantic\nrepresentation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias\nfeatures from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key\nmetrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual\nsensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong\ndetection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify\nbias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high\nsemantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high\ninterpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias\nassociation mechanisms within language models.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets.

To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity.

In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA.

Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments\non the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior\nperformance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of\nright-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD\nprogression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability."}

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the\nfidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to\nboost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing\nper-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of\ndenoising steps.

Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of\nExperts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each\nspecialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a\ntemporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal\nconsistency and enhance weak supervision.

The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

Nevertheless,\ngenerative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input\nimage do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be\ninferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar\nrelighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or\noutperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting\nsynthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes."}
