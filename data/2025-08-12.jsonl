To\nexplore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination\nsearching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to\napproximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with\nthe highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of\nhallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching\nconstructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false\ndescriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of\nat least 9\\% and up to 23\\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,\nsignificantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities.

The key innovation is\nto train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score\nduring training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use\nnoun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores\nas a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark\ndatasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training\nallows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent\ndialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the\ninput prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups.

With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key\ninformation based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have\nsignificantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods\nfocus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,\nwhile ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the\nobjective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving\ntowards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel\nframework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining\naccurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation\nof the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy\nbrought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,\nfirst, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help\nthe model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),\nthereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal\nAttention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships\nbetween the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical\nexperiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has\nachieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise.

While quantitative evaluations of compositional and\nnon-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative\nevaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic\nexpressions representing focus or emphasis such as \"it was John who left\". We\nfill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply\nto FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our\ncompositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of\nmodification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of\nUniversal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing\nsentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our\ncompositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis\nmethods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our\ncompositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER\nthat uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and\nmodification.

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings.

The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity\ninformation inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion\ntransformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,\nunlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing\nDiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states\nby weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This\nalleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture\ndistinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive\nmodule is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video\ndecoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting\ntheir long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,\nthereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency.

We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions.

However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces\nmajor challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial\nuncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating\nprompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of\nour framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts\n(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects\nwithin a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.\n(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the\ntext token, enabling precise spatial control.

This includes both surface-level\nattributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such\nas themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general\nhuman preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual\nvariability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address\nthese limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language\nModels, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn\npersonalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive\npreference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''\nand ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest\nrepresentations among existing users, enabling the model to activate\ngroup-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in\npreference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar\naesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating\nimages that align with individual tastes.

Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a\nLow-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a\nfundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the\nGaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of\ngenerative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM\nmid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based\non this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a\nuniversal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR\ninjects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,\nincorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the\nlatent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to\neliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we\ninstantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:\nOMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate\nthat OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and\nqualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes\noverwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a\n1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which\nyields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We\nalso generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our\ntwo-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion."}

Current methods, however, often prioritize basic\nvisual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse\nshot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This\nyields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication\nand true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user\nstudies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence\nto intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its\nability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically\ncoherent subsequent shots."}

This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video\ndiffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos\nwithout post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing\nexisting models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They\ntypically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio\nembeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via\ncross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related\npriors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation\nacross video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to\ndrift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,\nStableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents\nerror accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose\na novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio\nsynchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent\nprediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the\ninfinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy\nthat fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness\nof StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on\nisolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse\nquestion types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical\nestimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or\nstructurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of\nincreasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)\nintegrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic\ninference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep\naccuracy declines as chart complexity increases.
