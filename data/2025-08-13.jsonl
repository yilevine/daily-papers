Recent advances in artificial intelligence\n(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved\nthe precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations\nof manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques\nfor detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI\ndevelopments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:\nhyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,\nmodified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured\ntaxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting\nadvanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent\nwork and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern\nAI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in\nspeed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical\nVision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease\ndetection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by\ndiscussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining\npromising directions for future research."}

In this paper, we propose\nan Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for\n\\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from\nboth global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules\ninto functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are\ncombined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,\nstarting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the\nassociations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial\nrepresentation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.\ntexture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate\nmolecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs\nAdaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by\ndynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.\nExperimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images.

In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive\nMargin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance\nscenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update\nmechanisms.\n  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining\nwith the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In\nAlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the\nlength-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In\nMT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,\nparticularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.\n  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based\nobjectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource\nconstraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment."}

As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,\nthis knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without\nthe need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few\nlayers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing\nthe process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,\noften surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.\nExperimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and\nefficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization\nabilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual\nrecognition tasks."}

To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our\nHVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL."}

However, vision-language knowledge\ndistillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust\ngeneralization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,\nwhich are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting\nsuch large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies\nentropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal\ndata (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,\nconducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.\nThis enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while\nrequiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks.

This substantial divergence in\nmethodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the\nlack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that\nnaturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding\ndivide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports\nboth source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from\nall prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct\nconsequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted\nadaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic\nprobabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring\nhow humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each\nimage can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and\na spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This\ndisentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful\nprediction with intrinsic adaptability.

Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches.

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information.

Through a comprehensive investigation of manga\nnarrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models\nexcel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal\ncausality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story\ncomprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines\nfine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and\nretrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these\nlimitations.\n  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual\nelements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)\ncomprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct\ninference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity\nanalysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint\nrepresentations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters\nwith 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form\nnarrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative\nstorytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our\nfindings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,\nstruggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and\ncausal inference across extended sequences.

VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due\nto the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain\nshifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such\nscenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a\nthreshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic\nsettings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored\nfor VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our\napproach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative\ndata points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical\ninnovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables\nthe identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from\npseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the\nframework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,\nensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts\nacross various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that\nsimulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and\nrefinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that\nour method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world\nsimulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and\nsignificantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments."}

Visual\nLanguage Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic\nreasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.\nHowever, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features\nand couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage\nerror propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs\nto perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D\nincorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving\ntasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint\nsemantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during\nearly training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in\nlater stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions.

In this work, we present a pioneering study on\nscaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance\ntrends through scaling laws.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.
