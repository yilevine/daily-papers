This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR.

Empirical workarounds have\nbeen explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce\nsmoothed estimates.

However, this approach runs into\ndifficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a\nnon-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental\nproblem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences\"\nin an LLM Markov category.

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The\nmapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this\nprocess.

PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a\nlarge language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific\nguideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and\ncompleteness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these\nfactors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and\ncontext, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage\napplies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring\nbaseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of\ncoverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,\nand allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger\nones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit\npreference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better\ncalibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.\nBy enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the\ngroundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised\nlanguage generation systems."}

These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous\nobject boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,\nsuch mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data\naugmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and\nits label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's\ngeneralization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel\naugmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to\naddress such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing\ncontrolled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving\nthe original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust\nrepresentations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves\nperformance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in\naverage on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even\nwithout bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit\nlabel noise.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used\nVSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark\nmodels, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and\nover 22.7\\% complexity reduction (in MACs).

Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance\nmotion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of\njointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains\nlargely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts\nhuman dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the\negocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose\nestimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the\ngenerated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical\ninputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines\nboth egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.\nDrawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we\ndevelop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly\ncaptures the skeleton structure of the human body.

We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that\njointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our\nframework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across\n62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,\ntemperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for\nstylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using\nefficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV\nachieves strong performance in temporal and \"what-if\" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1\n0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while\nsupporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a\npowerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring."}

However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a\nsignificant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage\nlarge-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.\nUnfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because\nof the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to\nweak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular\nanatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored\nfor X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the\npre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:\nanatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss.
