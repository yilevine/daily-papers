We hypothesize that biological rhythms, particularly\nhormonal cycles, serve as natural relevance filters that could address this\nfundamental challenge. We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual\nand circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts\ngenerated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen,\ntestosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic\nanalysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological\nphases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation\nand circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal\nintrospection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates\nsubtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological\nexpectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme\nhormonal ranges.

We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid\nagentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit\nlinguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our\napproach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and\ncoreference resolution to create structured memory entries.

Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with\nnegligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and\ninfrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the\ndamage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with\npixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel\nWeather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of\n14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding\nground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm\ngeneralization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and\na real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean\nimages, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we\npropose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network\n(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.\nSpecifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep\nfeatures, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted\nfrom the backbone with weather features for SOD.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints.

The BSC submission to the WMT25\nGeneral Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of\nSALAMANDRATA.

To\naddress this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'\nunderstanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core\nstages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,\nwhere an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic\nunits and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and\nAdaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or\noptimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments\non the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and\nsubstantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all\nevaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like \"Text\" and\n\"Composition\". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators\n(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with\nInfinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline\nInfinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each\nDeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,\nhuman evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual\nquality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between\nhigh-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and\naccurate image generation."}

To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving.

SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo\ncolorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct\nprocessing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our\nprimary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two\nimages, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors.

This characteristic renders\nadvanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as\nthey are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image\nis independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error\naccumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.\nTo address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented\nperspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency\nAugmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent\nconsistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented\nbaseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,\nwe introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency\nrepresentation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module\n(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware\nview through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module\n(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information\ninteraction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe\nmaterials.

Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and\nexplainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to\nshortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel\nRSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253\nquestions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or\nmore cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.\n  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model\ncalled Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its\ndecisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures,\nwe show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy\ndecision-making in RSVQA systems."}

A primary challenge arises from ambiguity\nintroduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing\ncorresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as\nocclusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit\nphotometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that\nutilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along\nthe epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we\nfinetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:\nleft-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the\nright camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right\ncameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit\nphotometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''\nmethod that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular\ndepth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both\ntraining and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmark datasets."}

This study\ninvestigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a\nstate-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated\ndetection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is\nconducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and\nRT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of\ncoastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves\nmarginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\\% IoU\n(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's\n0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized\nat a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a\nsubstantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the\nRT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more\npractical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its\nsuperior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy.

Project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/VAP/", "summary": "We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for\naction-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining\ntransferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation\nfaces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive\nactions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while\nagent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain\ntransferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we\npropose to \"render\" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic\nrepresentations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain\nadaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for\ntheir generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct\nskeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions\n(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of\naction-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into\npretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable\nprecise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of\ncross-domain dynamics.

While many techniques have\nadvanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse\ntopologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent\ntopological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts\nthe establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,\nthe current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different\ntopological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven\napproaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,\ntraining-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only\none or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set\nof bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that\nMotion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both\nsimilar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios.
