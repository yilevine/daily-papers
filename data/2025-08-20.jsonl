The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and\nexclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We\napply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from\n1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across\nmultiple linguistic dimensions.

We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence\nevaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base\ntheir predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to\nmeasure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures\nwhether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted\nprobabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability\ndiagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its\nmultiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:\nnatural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal\nlow interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration\nsimilarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between\nmodels. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to\ntheir large counterparts.

However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this\nprocess by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,\nenabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base\nattack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models\nacross CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how\nto obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action\ndetection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,\npoints, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple\nactive learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type\nfor each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is\nintroduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective\ntraining.
