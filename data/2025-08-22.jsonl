These methods involve computing\nthe argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not\ndifferentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,\nto enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this\nlong-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the\nonly way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative\ntraining objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.\nEmpirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial\nlandmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during\ntraining while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology\nreasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision.

We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity.

Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,\ntime-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve\nthis, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under\nvarious lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve\nrobustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and\nYOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.\nExperimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy\nand low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as\nautomated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation\nparameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and\nF1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of\n0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4\nmodel (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying\nmicroscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the\nmAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve\narea was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).\nYOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent\ndetection applications, even though its convergence is slower."}

These approaches enable effective segmentation across a\nrange of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face\nchallenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying\nspecific nuclei subtypes or particular cells.
