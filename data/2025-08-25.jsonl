This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts\n(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori\nreasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the\nlogical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This\nreflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as\no1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the\nperformance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage\napproach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of\nLLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.\nSecondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge\ngraphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,\nwhich trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning.

Moreover, due to the\nconsiderable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence\nof comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and\ncomputational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese\nwriting.

Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such\nformat biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and\nwhat internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.\n  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the\nformat bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned\nquestions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an\nheterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first\nstage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of\nLLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including\ninformation richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these\nbiases.

Specifically, we test whether persona-based\nmodels can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,\npromoting misinformation or biased narratives.\n  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate\nrealistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their\nbeliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.\nPersuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief\ndistributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are\nfurther probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with\nadditional models.\n  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt\ntone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,\nand legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate\nmisinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing\nstereotypes and widening inequities.

Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,\nMAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,\ntheir cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we\npropose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by\nextending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving\nperformance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of\nMAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,\nillustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human\nknowledge. We release our benchmark at\nhttps://github.com/mhjiang0408/MAC_Bench."}

The central\nfocus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn\neffectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant\nunlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both\nmethodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular\naddressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,\nspatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is\norganized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for\nobject discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned\nfrom large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly\ntrains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on\nobject detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised\ncontrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in\nremote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification\nusing both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These\ncontributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural\nand remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative\nresearch projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future\nresearch directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning\nfor real-world applications."}

However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict\nconsistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,\nwhich limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by\nconvolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection\naccuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a\nnovel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and\ndiffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,\nsubmanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure\ncomputational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth\nof the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)\ndiffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich\nspatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to\nstrengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels.

To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation.

CoT length is\ninformative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\\approx 70\\%$),\nand carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\\approx 9\\%$), indicating that CoT\nlength predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,\ni.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.\nFinally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more\nsalient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than\ncorrect responses.

By quantifying the\ninformation captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis\nreveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more\ndeterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating\ntargeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy\nAttention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention\nmaps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant\nre-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves\nsimilar or higher accuracy at $\\leq$20\\% sparsity in attention maps and\ncompetitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer\nmodels."}

Despite significant efforts, alignment\nand safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against\njailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful\ncontent. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from\ntargeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces\n\\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders\n(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with\ndifferent jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal\nrepresentations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety\nguardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing\nmodel capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in\nmechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn\nhuman-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for\ndesigning more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.\nCode will be released upon publication."}

To fill\nthis gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy\nchange and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round\nself-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the\naccuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp\n- \\alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$\nrepresents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\\alpha$ determines the\nrate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated\nand the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single\nround of self-correction.

How are language and\nimages organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and\nmodality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\non the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,\nand AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of\nlearned directions, or \"concepts\". We find that, compared to other methods of\nlinear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,\nwhile also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different\nseeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts\ncaptured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that\ncommonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,\nwhile most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not\nmerely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace\nthat defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good\nmodality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To\nquantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that\nidentifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text\ninputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even\nsingle-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We\nrelease interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to\nexplore the organization of the concept spaces.
