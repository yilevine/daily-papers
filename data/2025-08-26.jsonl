The\nproposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues\nthrough four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based\nCNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning\nCNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial\nattention mechanism.

Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract\nmodality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To\nmaintain the internal structural relationships between samples,\nSimilarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,\nCollaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual\nlearning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and\ncomplementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC\nbiomarker prediction using uni-modal data.

In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding\n(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the\nhuman subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective\nrelationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,\nwhich complicates model fitting.

In this paper, we formally define\nand demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first\ntime. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of\nwatermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or\nremoved, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To\naddress this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named\nAdversarial Interference Simulation (AIS).

While most existing detection methods\nprimarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake\ncontents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals\nin advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake\ndetection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more\nsensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations\nwithin texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized\nperturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in\nnon-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts\npreliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then\nintroduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture\nperturbations.

Existing methods attempt to fuse visual\ninformation into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence\nlength issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within\nthe model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower\nvisual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an\nefficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and\nfusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the\ninherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and\nlanguage models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it\ndynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic\ngranularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The\nfused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being\ndirectly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding\nlayer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also\ndynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small\nnumber of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of\ncross-modal information at the same semantic granularity.

The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through\npretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation\ncapabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive\nevaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,\nachieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean\nconditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and\n92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight\nRAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to\ndetect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a\npractical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect\ndata curation is challenging."}

Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the\ncomputational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The\ntext-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token\npruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.\nHowever, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing\nlater in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's\noutput. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens\ncorresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning\nthat disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we\npresent an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency\nbias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting\nmechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their\nspatial positions in the image.

To enable multimodal\nanalysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG\nsignal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood\npressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and\nstress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its\nquality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release\nof our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the\ndevelopment of AI medical assistants."}

First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also\nintroduced to address the bias problem.
