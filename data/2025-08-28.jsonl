However, these methods rely on\nfragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds,\nformats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for\ntasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based\nneuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and\ntrustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with\ndeterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its\nglobal datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA),\nconstructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton\nstructure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic\ntraceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles\ncontext and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit\nstructure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making\nit better suited for domain transfer and interoperability.

Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational\nhumor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work,\nwe wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks\nconfers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this\nfragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types\ncontinuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,\nanti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this\nevolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by\ncapturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a\nseries of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing\ndifferent humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3\ndatasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models\nare capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen\ndatasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%)\nwith minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests\nrelations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best\nenabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and\ncode."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called\nJoint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), which integrates the\ncomplementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to enhance gas leak\nrepresentation and segmentation. Recognizing that gas leaks are sporadic and\nmany video frames may contain no leak at all, our method incorporates a\npost-processing step to reduce false positives caused by noise and non-target\nobjects, an issue that affects many existing approaches. Extensive experiments\nconducted across diverse scenarios show that JVLGS significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods. We evaluate our model under\nboth supervised and few-shot learning settings, and it consistently achieves\nstrong performance in both, whereas competing methods tend to perform well in\nonly one setting or poorly in both.

Existing methods typically\norganize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)\nrepresentations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues\nessential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we\nfirst introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for\ncollaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,\nmassive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and\naligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural\ninformation. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception\nframework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a\npoint-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence\nmodeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop\nprocess, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level\nrefinement to mitigate localization noise.

As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models.

Supervised\ndetectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial\npost-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level\nstatistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired,\nmodel-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a\ncommunity-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are\nfirst extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature\nvector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities\nare transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature,\nproducing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum\nexhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is\npresent. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack\nsuch gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male\nversus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic\ncounterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled\nsynthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves\nover 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for\nreal image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones.

In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality.

SR on LIBERO,\n71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv\nBridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.\nThese findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise\naction modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to\nlarger models and datasets."}

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel calibration framework that incorporates a\ndual-fisheye camera model into the 3D Gaussian splatting pipeline. Our approach\nnot only simulates the realistic visual artifacts produced by dual-fisheye\ncameras but also enables the synthesis of seamlessly rendered 360-degree\nimages. By jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters alongside calibration\nvariables that emulate lens gaps and angular distortions, our framework\ntransforms imperfect omnidirectional inputs into flawless novel view synthesis.\nExtensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces\nseamless renderings-even from imperfect images-and outperforms existing\n360-degree rendering models."}

To address this gap, we propose\nAudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)\nwith TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory\npossesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It\nemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered\nsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and\nemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)\nDecoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser\ncollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for\nintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence\npreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension\nand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory\neliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy\nbetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,\nencompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound\nnarratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both\nsingle-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA\nbaselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

This is a critical limitation given the\nscarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework\nthat integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor\n(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,\nSpecialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner\nfor each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of\ntask trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all\nsuccessful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated\ndataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.\nThis equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.\nEvaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,\nCODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art\namong open-source models."}

In this work, we\nintroduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning\nabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance.

Through extensive\nexperiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs\nexhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap\ncompared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that\ncognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.\nHowever, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas\nhuman correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern\ncomplexity.
