Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)\nmechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of\ninput lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while\nmaintaining model performance.

We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench.

This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,\nnamely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based\nDocument-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and\nreconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM\nperformance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales."}

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches."}

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix.

However, the modalities available in\nclinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area\nthat stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular\nsubtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized\ntreatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable\nand loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from\nvarious modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,\nand histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our\nprimary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily\naccommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down\nwith minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,\nmaking it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a\ndual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional\nimage-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach\nresults in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new\nmultimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance\nacross a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that\nintegrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health\nrecords, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping."}

Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire\nvideo as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online\nprocessing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling\nState-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,\nState-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and\nrecurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which\nare otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,\neffectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly\nsuitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,\nwithout having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more\nbeneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach\nscales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs."}

Specifically, we introduce text modality to\nenhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.\nWith the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of\nthe same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text\nrepresentations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained\nvisual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that\nalleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while\nfacilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to\nalleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the\ntextual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)\nstrategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We\nfurther propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance\nthe generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing\ndynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation\nresults on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous\nstate-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by\n2.0\\% and 4.7\\% respectively."}

Considering the practical scenarios where the\ndefect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and\ncomputational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without\nusing ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we\npropose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect\ndetection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the\ngenerative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall\nimages to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our\nproposed CLIP-based Fr\\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in\nJTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to\nsynthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of\nbetter quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data\naugmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road\ndefect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no\nensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters\ncompared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for\ndeployment on edge devices in practice."}

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning\nbeyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing\ncomprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts\nand around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models\nreveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex\nhigh-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind\nas a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements\nfrom prompts.
