Frameworks\ndesigned to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on\nidentifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by\napplying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a\ndisconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the\ndownstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\ndeveloping a principled topic identification method grounded in the\nDeterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key\ncontribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for\nhigh-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a\ncomputationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,\ncan be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means\nthat inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By\napplying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we\ngenerate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent\nbut is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the\nprompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM\nframework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations."}

Project website:\n  https://dense-functional-correspondence.github.io/", "summary": "Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks\nsuch as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting\nof matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the\neffect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences\nshould be established. This is because object parts that enable specific\nfunctions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the\ndefinition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and\npropose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.\nThe main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language\nmodels to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then\nintegrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to\ndistill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can\nestablish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and\nreal evaluation datasets as task benchmarks.

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly\nlearning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this\nintegral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the\npioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of\neach flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s\n(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high\nvisual and geometric fidelity.
