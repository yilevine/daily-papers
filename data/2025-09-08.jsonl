To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted\nusing a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally\nintroducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,\nconsisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for\nfacial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that\nfacial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived\nrisk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model\nwas implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated\nwell with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective\nperceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and\nhighlighting areas for future research."}

We focus on\n''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can\nrestore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full\nprompt.

Specifically, models often\ncondense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which\nalign well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the\ncontext. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the\nsequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task\nidentity being reliably decodable throughout the context.

To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of\nLLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework\nconsisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the\nvarying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual\nhallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models\nand tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently\ndemonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a\ncomparative performance with reasoning-based models.
