While techniques like\nActive Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying\ninformative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight\nof human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an\nemployed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\napproaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine\nlearning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),\neffective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.\nThis thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and\ninvestigating \"VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection\".\nVILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,\ntogether with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views.

For example, a model that can change a variable name like\nuserIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index\nwithout reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and\ndiscovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned\non forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability\nto reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,\nthey developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three\ntypes of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative\nexamples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.\nThis approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level\npattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally\nwithout explicit reverse training.

This research addresses this\ngap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We\nsystematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and\nYOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical\ninfrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior\nanalysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper\ninsights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our\nresults reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,\nrather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing\nthe backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a\nshallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These\nconfigurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up\nto 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average\nprecision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient\nanalysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for\nmoderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and\npractical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies.

Prior work has proposed representing a method\nas a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.\nHowever, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly\nsimilar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address\nquestions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not\nexplicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific\nsense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the\nquestion and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The\nLLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing\nit to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,\nwe extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or\nhidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond\nconventional similarity constraints.

We find that, regardless of the length of\nthe biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant\nto a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and\nintegrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire\nbiasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information\nvolume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic\ncorrelation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and\ncalculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate\nrepresentations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,\nphrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases.

To\naddress these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.\nHowever, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to\nrobustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image\nquality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW\nconcepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or\ncelebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright\nand legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close\ndistances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained\nmanipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel\nmethod specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in\neasing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing\nthe concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference\nsubspace that minimizes the distance between the two.

This dissertation resolves this\nconflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike\nan optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first\naddresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by\nproposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism.

While recent efforts have improved the former,\nthe reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.\nPitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable\ndiscrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm\nfor the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for\nthe same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce\nMeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of\ndistance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics\nachieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is\nsubstantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance\nquantization.

MedSeqFT introduces two core\ncomponents: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies\ndownstream samples most representative of the original pre-training\ndistribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and\nGeneralization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge\ndistillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention\nof pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets\ncovering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial\nperformance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,\nevaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT\nenhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses\nof loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of\nMedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,\nknowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving\nclinical tasks. Code will be released."}

H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM).
