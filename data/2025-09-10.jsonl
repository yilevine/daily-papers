These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt\ntheir communication style and emotional expression to different social and task\ncontexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training\nframework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for\nvarying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five\npersonality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that\ncombines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual\ntrait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially\noutperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional\nintelligence.

In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the\nmaintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate\nglobal features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic\nnodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone\ncross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL\nincludes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,\nmodality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive\nbidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network\nbased on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation\ndatasets.

Our key insight is that small target detection and\nbackground discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video\nbackgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable\npriors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and\nsparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the\nbackground, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on\nthese insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires\nminimal assumptions about target characteristics.

The system uses a fast, low-resolution\npass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection\nconfidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x\nspeedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.\nThis work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying\nhigh-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus\nfrom pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that\nmaximize throughput."}

Targeting vision-related domains,\nthis paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a\ndecoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match\na user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past\nstudies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an\nimage are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose\nfeatures are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a\nguided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a\npre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the\nfeature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.\nOne practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of\ndifferent DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The\nexperimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision\ntransformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features\nremarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into\nthese DNNs' feature spaces."}

Our generation pipeline is modular,\nscalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating\nacross distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA\ncomprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k\nreasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To\npromote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model\ncollaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and\nLLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models\nelaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual\nstructures into the dataset.

Project Page: https://mini-o3.github.io/", "summary": "Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools\nwith reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems."}

However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are\nrarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain\ngaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We\npropose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key\ncomponents. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and\npose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare\nrefinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy\ndiversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with\nsynthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D\ngeneration to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging\nbenchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further\ndemonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the\npracticality of our method in real-world manipulation.

In this paper, we present\nVIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization\nstrategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of\npre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this\nalignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details\nfrom the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual\nknowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex\nvisual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all\ntasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks.
