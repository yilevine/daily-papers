However, manual coding is both difficult and\ntime-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can\npotentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of\nstructured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires\nmapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge\nsources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the\nuse of external resources for representing the input documents has been\nunderexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the\ninput documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that\nprovide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting\nknowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with\n23\\% of the original text while retaining 90\\% of the information. We assess\nthe effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it\ninto the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD.

Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs\nand three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to\nbaselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at\nhigher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to\ndisambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled\nresponses to a given prompt.

Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,\nShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of\n+10.3\\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods,\nwhile PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is\n12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making\nit suitable for real-world deployment.

Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by\nMistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches,\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each\nwith and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance\nwas evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base\nInstruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions,\nwith performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM)\nand the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned\non human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models\nsignificantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT\nfidelity ($\\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\\chi^2(5) =\n140.37, p < .001$).

However, this transformation often leads to information loss due\nto perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby\ndegrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method\ndirectly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts\nonly the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,\nmodern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples\nare similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they\nstill produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown\nscale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth.

This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal\ncross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the\nmodel's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI,\nwith an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously\nperform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging\nlarge-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder\nlearns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner.

Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the\nencoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module\nemploys adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent\nand distinct local features across RGB-T modalities.

To address these gaps, this paper presents three key\ncontributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods\nacross architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature\nutilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating\nmodern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair\nmulti-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the\ncritical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational\ncomplexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising\ndirections for future research.

Nevertheless, current approaches remain\nvulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and\nadverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that\nintegrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,\nproviding complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we\npresent MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed\nmethod employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into\nSAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong\ngeneralization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating\nauxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM\nSAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We\nevaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,\nwhere MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze\nmodality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard\nsubsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms\ncompeting methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the\neffectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

To solve this,\nwe explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the\nfixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content\nrepresentation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a\ncompact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the\n\\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for\ngenerating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining\nthe diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational\ncomplexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.\nExperiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary\nhigh-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds."}

While there has been extensive research in\napplying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models\nremain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across\ndatasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time\nintervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art\ntemporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis,\nand add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn\nrobust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets\ncomprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our\nmodel across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis\nclassification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.\nImportantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and\ncontrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven\ndownstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across\ntasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its\ncapacity for robust performance across clinical applications.
