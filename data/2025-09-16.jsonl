This thesis presents a\nreal-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in\nshared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset\nuser to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,\nensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.\nRemoval is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,\nfollowed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,\nimplemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be\nportable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D\nscanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection\nand a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for\nhigh-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame\nrates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished\nreality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications."}

Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were\nextracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25\nclassifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on\nthree datasets and tested on the fourth.

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches.

This study used electroencephalography\n(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.\nBehavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as\ncomparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor\nelicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the\nprocessing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive\nPotential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional\nresponse. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial\nexpectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal\ndynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an\nincreasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor\ndemonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a\ndecreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain\ncan dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of\ncumulative reinforcement challenges \"algorithm aversion\" in humor, as it\ndemonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an\nintensified emotional reward.

Extensive experiments on Tanks\\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360\ndatasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed\nSVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\\(\\times\\) compared to MaskGS and\n5.63\\(\\times\\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR\ndrops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,\nand more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time\napplications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception."}

In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen.

The most common way of representing skin\ntone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has\nbeen criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for\nlighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance.

We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately.

Most previous works\ncumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store\nand utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid\ncatastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between\nclasses shared across domains at each time step.

We address key\nlimitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in\ndepth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each\nenvironment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates\nuncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability\ndistributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,\nwe eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,\nenhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over\nexisting methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative\nAI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a\ndual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive\nprocesses and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,\neach carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue\nact types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for\ninformation, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using\nlanguage creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different\ntypes of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social\ngreetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that\ngenerative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful\nways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users\nthink and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more\nconfidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides\nempirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive\ndevelopment in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation\nand socio-cultural affiliation.

Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by\nintrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to\nthe high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot\nprocess high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before\ndownsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling\nfine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details.

Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on\npreference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models\nfor preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable\nimprovement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the\ntarget LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a\npair of responses with varying preference levels.

This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination\nmitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training\nstrategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the\npreference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous\nenhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that\nAPASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models\nbut also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based\nmethods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and\ngeneralization capability.

Using only\nmonocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and\nclassifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm\nrail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a\nclass-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),\nwhile a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated\nat an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore\ndelivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers\nbefore dangerous situations escalate.

Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs\nexhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information\ndiminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a new VRM \\textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection\nbased on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for\nreinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning\ndata by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,\nenabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual\nattention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based\non visual information. Therefore, \\textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates\nsignificant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.\nFurthermore, \\textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent\nreliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective\nenhancement in visual reflection capabilities."}

Most existing methods\nemploy either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations\nbuilt from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex\nbrain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for\ndefining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and\nfunctional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are\ntrained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.\nFurther, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional\nrelationships, and guide GNN-based classification.

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos.

This\ncompromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,\nsuppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,\nwe introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for\nMulti-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on\nimplicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit\ncorrespondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the\nattention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable\nfull-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing\ntask. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability\nof models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with\ntext guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:\nopening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects\nlike a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes\nlike moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round\nworkflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the\nDragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual\nquality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation.
