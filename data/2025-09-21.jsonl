Recent\nwork has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal\nrepresentations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;\nSMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can\nenhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for\nhallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them\nacross three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact.

Despite their success, conventional skip connections\nexhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature\nconstraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of\nfeature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is\ntransmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The\nintra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale\nfeature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global\ncontextual information.

(2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the\nintra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on\nglobal contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature\nintegration.

However, obtaining such human-based measures is not always\nfeasible or straightforward. One promising approach is to augment human norming\ndatasets by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict these characteristics\ndirectly, a practice that is rapidly gaining popularity in psycholinguistics\nand cognitive science. However, the novelty of this approach (and the relative\ninscrutability of LLMs) necessitates the adoption of rigorous methodologies\nthat guide researchers through this process, present the range of possible\napproaches, and clarify limitations that are not immediately apparent, but may,\nin some cases, render the use of LLMs impractical.\n  In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for estimating word\ncharacteristics with LLMs, enriched with practical advice and lessons learned\nfrom our own experience. Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs\nand the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial\nperformance gains in certain scenarios. A major emphasis in the guide is the\nvalidation of LLM-generated data with human \"gold standard\" norms.

Recently, a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR\nwas proposed, showing potential for better data utilization.

To address these\nissues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does\nnot need class labels or pre-trained SR models.

Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature\nAlignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit\ndegradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have\nassumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),\nwhile through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models\npredominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct\ndegradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we\npropose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and\ndenoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be\nseamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring\narchitectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance\ncompared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional\nbenchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios."}

While recent vision language models (VLMs)\nalleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on\nsingle pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of\nvisual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for\nImage Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image\nclassification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an\nOutliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted\nprompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained\ndescriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent\nsynthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,\nproducing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly\ndecomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective\nsynthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training\nand monolithic VLM reasoning.

FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity\nbetween the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,\nwhich are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector.

The expert selection loss further\nsharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard\nMoE activation patterns.

In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the\nattribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS\nstrategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the\ntemporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We\nevaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods\non three common STVG benchmarks.\n  The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG."}

In this work, we draw new links between quantization\nand model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the\nquantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method\nexplicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added\nconstraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased\ntext generation for protected groups.

While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior.
