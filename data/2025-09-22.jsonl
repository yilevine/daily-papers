Moreover, such suppression-based\nmethods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal\nactivations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the\nactivation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''\nentities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the\nactivation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward\nthose of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space.

We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects.

At the methodological level, most current\napproaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a\npost-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further\nimprovements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new\nbenchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the\ndataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more\nfine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved\nroads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)\nmethod, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and\nbackgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model\ncollaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its\nability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal\ninteraction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction\nFusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the\nmodel's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,\nJL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive\nresults compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,\nand 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively.

UDG confronts the\nchallenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.\nAlthough some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,\nsuch domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,\nwe address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a\nMinimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves\nall semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)\nmaximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We\ntheoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information\ntheory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency\nand minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we\nimplement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a\nlearnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve\nsufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel\nsemantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism\nfor capturing adequate variation.

In this paper, a novel lightweight\nframework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This\nframework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and\nKalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode\nattention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs\nearly fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road\ninfrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.\nThe PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among\nhistorical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich\nthe diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors\nis designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments\nshow that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq\ndataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory\nprediction in V2X scenarios."}

We introduce a lightweight defense using\ntensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.\nBy decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters\nadversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and\nFlickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\\%\nperformance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\\% to 19.8\\%. On\nCOCO, it recovers 8.1\\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\\% to 11.9\\%.\nAnalysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual\nstrength ($\\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,\nplug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs."}

While existing methods\naddress training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination\nmodels, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model\nsubsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified\nmodality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical\nself-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges\nrepresentation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,\nfeature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the\nhybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the\nintrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for\nmissing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant\ncontrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among\nincomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight\nreverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual\nsemantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid\nconsistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality\ncombinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and\nwhistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under\ndiverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

However, existing open-source\nmodels often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We\npresent Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially\nreduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated\ntraining recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters\nthat produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete\ntokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified\nautoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image\ntokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image\ntokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe\nover understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both\ncapabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,\nand is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich\nevaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer."}
