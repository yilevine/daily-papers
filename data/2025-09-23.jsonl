Thyroid ultrasound\nimages are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple\ncomplex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence,\nwe second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local\nDCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context.\nAnother disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering\nof ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third\nconjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the\ntextural features and propose the integration of another popular texture\ncapturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT.

In this work, we introduce RephQA, a\nbenchmark for evaluating the readability of LLMs in public health question\nanswering (QA). It contains 533 expert-reviewed QA pairs from 27 sources across\n13 topics, and includes a proxy multiple-choice task to assess informativeness,\nalong with two readability metrics: Flesch-Kincaid grade level and professional\nscore. Evaluation of 25 LLMs reveals that most fail to meet readability\nstandards, highlighting a gap between reasoning and effective communication. To\naddress this, we explore four readability-enhancing strategies-standard\nprompting, chain-of-thought prompting, Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), and a token-adapted variant. Token-adapted GRPO achieves the best\nresults, advancing the development of more practical and user-friendly public\nhealth agents. These results represent a step toward building more practical\nagents for public health."}

However, these datasets frequently fall short of\nproviding cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this\npaper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural\nreasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich\nimages in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with\nmultiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the\nrelevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the\nfirst stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating\nfrom the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group.\nNotably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type.\nProgression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is\nchosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural\nartifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose\ndiverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which\n1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators.

Recent studies\nalso show that coordinated multi-agent systems exhibit enhanced decision-making\nand reasoning abilities through collaboration. However, due to the\nvulnerabilities of individual LLMs and the difficulty of accessing all agents\nin a multi-agent system, a key question arises: If attackers only know one\nagent, could they still generate adversarial samples capable of misleading the\ncollective decision? To explore this question, we formulate it as a game with\nincomplete information, where attackers know only one target agent and lack\nknowledge of the other agents in the system. With this formulation, we propose\nM-Spoiler, a framework that simulates agent interactions within a multi-agent\nsystem to generate adversarial samples.

Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting\nsparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works\ntypically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only\nwhen all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and\nM keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of\nattention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and\nleaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse\nattention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages\nsparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips\nentire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1\nslices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products\nbetween a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed\nsparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation\ncalled asynchronous-gather load. This load operation gathers a sparse set of\nrelevant key-value vectors from memory and arranges them into packed tiles in\nthe GPU's shared memory. Only a sparse set of keys relevant to those queries\nare loaded into shared memory when computing attention for a block of queries,\nin contrast to loading full blocks of key tokens in block-sparse attention. Our\nfine-grained sparse attention, applied to video diffusion models, achieves an\naverage 1.55X (up to 1.65X) speedup for 5 second, 480p videos, and an average\n1.41X (up to 1.49X) for 5 second, 720p videos on a single H100 GPU."}

Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are\ntypically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are\nnot typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative\ndistinctions between candidates.

One of the main disadvantages of this method is\nthe high computational cost and memory requirements. Since an exhaustive search\nis not feasible in large data stores, practitioners commonly use approximate\n$k$-NN MT lookup, yet even such algorithms are a bottleneck. In contrast to\nresearch directions seeking to accelerate $k$-NN MT by reducing data store size\nor the number of lookup calls, we pursue an orthogonal direction based on the\nperformance properties of approximate $k$-NN MT lookup data structures. In\nparticular, we propose to encourage angular dispersion of the neural hidden\nrepresentations of contexts.

Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this\nsetting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation.\nTraditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete\ninformation between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a\nsemi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a\nGaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework,\nmedical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames\nembedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This\nrepresentation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface\nreconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more\nefficient training than traditional neural implicit methods.

Event data offer significant benefits such as high temporal resolution\nand low latency, but their application to hand pose estimation is still limited\nby the scarcity of labeled training data. To address this, we repurpose real\nRGB datasets to train event-based estimators. This is done by constructing\npseudo-event-RGB pairs, where event data is generated and aligned with the\nground-truth poses of RGB images. Unfortunately, existing pseudo-event\ngeneration techniques assume stationary objects, thus struggling to handle\nnon-stationary, dynamically moving hands.

To overcome these limitations,\nWe introduce AttnComp, an adaptive, efficient and context-aware compression\nframework. By leveraging the attention mechanism of LLMs to identify relevant\ninformation, AttnComp employs a Top-P compression algorithm to retain the\nminimal set of documents whose cumulative attention weights exceeds a\npredefined threshold. In addition to compression, AttnComp estimates response\nconfidence by assessing the overall relevance of the retrieved content,\nenabling users to gauge response reliability.

Our approach introduces a\npathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator,\nallowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion\npatterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic\nvideos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity.\nClinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers.\nFurthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real\ndata and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream\ndiagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\\% and 8\\% respectively.

While depth information has the potential to\nalleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations,\nleading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of\ndepth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based\ndetector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we\npropose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft\ndepth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the\ndistillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These\nstrategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference,\nwithout requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost.\nBy incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD\nparadigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges.\nExperiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47,\nrespectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT\ndataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and\nclose-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that\npersonalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment\nenvironment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our\nmethod leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to\nbridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training\nenvironments.

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies,\npre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their\nimpact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios.

Current clinical\npractice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images.\nHowever, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic\nmodels from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical\nmodels is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to\nmismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning\ndata. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision\nfoundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and\nQSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into\na token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation\nfor classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices\nof the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary\nsegmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain\nnuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning,\nwhich improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of\npatients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes.\nOur approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation\nchallenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled\nQSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These\nresults highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR\nimages."}

However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental\naspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological\nfindings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational\nrelevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of\nanatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs\n(GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to\nlocalize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that\noverlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged\nacross nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a\nlocalization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%),\nall lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark\n(80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's\npredictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always\nprecisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical\nlocations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited\nanatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the\nlowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize\nto this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of\ncurrent MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating\nthem with task-specific tools for reliable use."}

While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in\nthose settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos\ninvolving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches,\nwhich sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur\nsignificant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model\noften misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key\ntemporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these\nlimitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling,\nhierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However,\nthese methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal\nrepresentations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a\nresult, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually\nencodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address\nthese foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play\nneuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language\nquestion into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton\nfrom frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to\nrigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical\nrequirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus\nimproving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional\nreasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model.
