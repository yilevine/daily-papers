This process is computationally intensive and\nincreases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly\nmethod for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over\nsignals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a\ndirect quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high\nuncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.\nTo test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements\nderived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and\nuse it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that\nNTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and\nsimple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.\nFurthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding\nonly the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection\nperformance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs\ninto the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or\nNTPs alone.

Unlike traditional language model\napproaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are\nmainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis\ncapabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this\nwork, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,\nUser-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs\nin conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a\nLLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL\ntraining, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in\nconversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy\n(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational\nrecommendation potential obtained from RL training.

Existing methods\noften rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,\nwhich are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast\nand high noise.

To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted\ndescription-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.\nExperiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a\nretrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction\nperformance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as\nlow as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis\nindicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,\nwhereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather\nevidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,\nforecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are\nindexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial\nprediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step\ntoward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and\nsmarter experiment prioritization."}

Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in\neach network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support\nit, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,\nand how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we\nsystematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in\nmid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from\nmodality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is\nrobust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered\n(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared\ncode is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a\nforced-choice \"Pick-a-Pic\" task shows that human preferences for image-caption\nmatches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model\npairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to\na single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions akin to human judgments.

Their performance has been driven by advances in frame\nsampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most\nrecently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified\nin earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains\nunexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box\npoisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID\ncompromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a\nclosed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal\nperturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction\nset constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow\nVideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini.

Real-world applications often face\nfew-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are\navailable and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language\nmodels (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness\ndepends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational\nPrompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn\nconversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),\nrelies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,\nContrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or\nLLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging\nthe model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product\ndomains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt\noften produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on\ntext-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented\ntasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP\nand CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when\neach user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when\nhigh-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive\nwhen such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational\nprompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and\ntraining-free constraints."}

Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,\nwe argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,\nfrom what plants to count to how to count plants.

We demonstrate that\nquantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident\npre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.\nIntriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other\nreliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these\nsame poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific\nquantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in\nzero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a\nstrict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights\nfor navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,\nand robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role."}

However, there are\ndisadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not\navailable using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal\nmechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.\nTo solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,\nwhich improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative\nsub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists\nof a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.\nQuestioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer\nthe main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question\nconsidering the generated sub-question information.

Our framework contains two plug-and-play\ncomponents operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the\nTemporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion\ncharacteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies\nWasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the\nfrequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness\nagainst person-specific spectral differences.
