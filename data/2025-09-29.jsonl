While prior works have explored\nbasic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual\ncontext. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for\nEfficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target\narchitecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and\nselectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica\nand Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path\nefficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits\nstrong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal\nfusion strategies in robotic navigation.

Most\ncurrent methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which\nsamples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and\nadjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample\ndiscrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional\ninformation in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.\nWhile preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven\nbeneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily\nconstraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To\naddress this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in\nRLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G\napproaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture\nembeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate\ndirectly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.\nEvaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive\nlanguage tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements\n(5--35 \\% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the\nQwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of\ntrajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency.

These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing\nrandom sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of\nthe original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias\ntowards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset.

This bottleneck is substantial; for\ninstance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of\n4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's\nweights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or\neven improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,\nOjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require\ncomplex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in\ndynamically tracking context shifts.

This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the\nprinciple of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of\nreconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.\n  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They\nleverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical\nsimplification of shapes.

Inspired by\nthis, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision\nby organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts\nserve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires\ntask-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and\nlimits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation\nmodels inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more\nunified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model\nadapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a\nframework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various\nvision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as\nvisual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the\nexpected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two\nperspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images\nand videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks\nfrom natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training.

While intuitive, this depth-first\npipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces\ninterference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply\nrestoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)\npipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness\nfor model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from\nsuboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods.

First, we enhance text-to-3D background\ngeneration by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and\ninpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D\nreconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target\nobject, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is\nextracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and\nseamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then\npositioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,\nensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is\ntemporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion\nhallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a\npart-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes\nmultiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations\nat each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of\nuser-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background."}

In this work, we present a systematic study\nof the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key\nvisual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a\ncarefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often\nproduce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental\nlimitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that\nthis phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably\nperceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the\nunbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In\nparticular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,\nintroduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at\ndifferent positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple\nyet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image\ntokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive\nexperiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without\nretraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal\nbenchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning.

This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query.

While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero\nshot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two\nstructural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB\nimages from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)\npatch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets\nand context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative\nvisual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation\nthat parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop\na scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware\npruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about\n97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt\ncontrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen\nRGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a\nperceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large\nDataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K\nperformance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels.

We\nintroduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for\ncomputer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal\nlanguage model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across\nthree core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,\nin-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis\ngenerates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)\nConsensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple\nfoundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum\nsuppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of\nLabeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object\ndiscovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per\nimage-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation\nmAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class\nimbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability\nto over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a\n10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x\nmore computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample\nefficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,\nscalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale\ndatasets."}

We introduce DeeptraceReward, the\nfirst fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates\nhuman-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises\n4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos.

We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of\ndeepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train\nmultimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and\nlocalizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by\n34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.\nInterestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.\nreal classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace\ndetection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language\nexplanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).\nBy foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a\nrigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video\ngeneration."}

Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable\ndata annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to\nmodels that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality\nand ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the\nlimitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.\nA primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the\ninherently subjective nature of what constitutes a \"good\" caption. We introduce\nCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that\nredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should\nenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the\ncorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM\ngenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a\nseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on\nthat caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image\ncaptioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple\nsettings.

We further propose\nan attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition\nbackground activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more\nlocalized heatmaps.
