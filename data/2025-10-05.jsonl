In particular,\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled\ntext-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy\nand perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending\nthese advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant\nchallenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing\nsubtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply\nimage-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally\ninconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent\nadvances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent\ndiffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal\ncausality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot\nor plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with\npriors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for\nautomatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction\nquality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong\nmeasurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.\nExtensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show\nsignificant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that\napply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both\nreconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency."}

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and\nmonotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable\nacross various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the\nscore interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the\npenalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly\nestimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),\nyielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled\nboth semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical\nminimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,\nthe model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic\ncontinuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory\naging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,\ntask-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in\nartificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von\nNeumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,\nand Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence."}

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

We introduce the first theoretical\nframework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling\ndynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through\nstochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as\ncontrol over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic\nalgorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base\nvelocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight\nfine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal\nwhile preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior\nattention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion\ncorrespondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed\nfor multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and\nStable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject\nalignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs\nefficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited\nprompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal\nControl for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art\nmulti-subject fidelity across models."}

In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to\ndiagnose reasoning-execution gaps.

By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)\nmetric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.\nThis joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)\nExecution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action\nbut execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but\nreasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results\nacross a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution\ngaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than\nreasoning gaps.

The\nprevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as\ntwo-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its\nderivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,\nwe question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and\nhence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that\ndraws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then\nboth models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena\ndatasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative\nincrease in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all\nfour rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for\nqueries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of\n1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider\nexisting draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates."}

Lots of work with\npre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource\nmodels and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.\nIn this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping\npipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a\npipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a\ntemporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a\nframe-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and\nsupports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new\ndomain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium."}
