Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nwith reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video\ncomprehension.

To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,\nrecent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),\nwhich replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks\nrely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create\ncalibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose\nOracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a\nmore general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate\nmodel responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce\n$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware\nadvantages.

Existing methods\nprimarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to\nunrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such\nartifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing\nfollowing the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this\ntwo-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall\nreconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework\nthat directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a\nphysics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically\ngrounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our\napproach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial\nrays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as\npolicy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy\n3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual\nfeatures from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both\ndetailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of\nreinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that\ntransfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the\nvision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated\nreinforcement learning rewards.

To address this challenge, we turn to\nrepresentation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing\nfeatures from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and\nQueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer\neffectively to downstream training.

We introduce a\nunified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression\nto address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering\nprocedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter\nand activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our\nframework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total\nparameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and\nlowering expert load variance by a factor of over three.

However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the\ndrafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that\nuses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts\nin a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR\nverifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,\nparallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally\nhighest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right\npath. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a\nspeed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two\npractical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this\nlattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and\n(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size\nbased on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length.

We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios.

We propose XTRA\n(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a\nnovel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual\nembeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,\naligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared\nsemantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions\ninto the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism\nenables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and\nwell-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that\nXTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,\nand alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:\n//github.com/tienphat140205/XTRA."}

With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from\nsocial media, automated methods for personality assessment have become\nincreasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis\nof unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main\nchallenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,\npersonality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology\nand NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these\nchallenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --\ncollected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse\ndiscussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000\nusers and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic\ninformation, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.\nExperiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model\nvalidity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality\nAssessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for\ninterpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements\nwith validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic\nsimilarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human\nevaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although\nfocused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this\ndomain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make\nit suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex\nlabel taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts."}

This saturates context limits and increases computational\ncost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security\nrisks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard\nrelevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action\nprediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that\nleverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from\naccessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning\nnoisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while\nreducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and\nWebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong\nbaselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant\nof FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection\nattacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success\nperformance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted\nLLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents\nthat are efficient, effective, and secure."}

In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing\ninternal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This\nprocess both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token\ngeneration latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs\ncommunicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the\ndeep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit\nintermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%\nhigher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text\ncommunication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average\n2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/thu-nics/C2C."}

In this paper, we\npropose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of\nreasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories\ninto structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the\nmost relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout\ngeneration. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting\nmethods across six benchmarks.

Reward models assess\nthe quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is\nalso performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI\nmodel.

Common challenges include\nsusceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,\nmethods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our\nposition paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help\novercome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward\nmodels on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.\nGrounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer\nalignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference\nelicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and\ncalibration-aware meta-evaluation."}

Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,\nspurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like\nlarge language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,\nproducing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior\nwork, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.\nTo our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the\nuncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty\nquantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for\nevaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation\nestimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method\nfor video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to\nrigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic\ncomponents; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in\nvideo models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we\ndisentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that\narising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark\nvideo datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total\nuncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and\neffectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents."}

While their\ncapabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those\nproblems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for\nthe phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual\nand text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,\nsuch as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive\ndecoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and\nattention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this\nwork, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach\nutilizes the \"image heads\" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive\nsamples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and\nQwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The\nresults demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of\nhallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding\nresources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD ."}
