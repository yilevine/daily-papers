Existing retrievers\nsuffer from poor performance since they either rely on shallow embedding\nsimilarity or employ interactive retrieving policies that demand excessive data\nlabeling and training cost.

This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system.

Existing methods, whether\nreconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based\n(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level\nmatching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely\noverlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal\nRGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D\nand RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.\nDespite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a\ncomprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate\nunified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching\nperspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a\ngeneric post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any\nUAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against\nnormal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable\nfiltering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,\nmitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies.

To address this, we introduce the first benchmark\ndataset of 200 politically significant and highly debated Bangla news articles,\nlabeled for government-leaning, government-critique, and neutral stances,\nalongside diagnostic analyses for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Our\ncomprehensive evaluation of 28 proprietary and open-source LLMs shows strong\nperformance in detecting government-critique content (F1 up to 0.83) but\nsubstantial difficulty with neutral articles (F1 as low as 0.00).

Our benchmark datasets include MedMCQA, MedQA-4Options, and\nPubMedQA, with the medical abstracts dataset emulating tasks aligned with real\nED physicians' daily tasks. Experimental results reveal that general-domain\nSLMs surprisingly outperform their medically fine-tuned counterparts across\nthese diverse benchmarks for ED. This indicates that for ED, specialized\nmedical fine-tuning of the model may not be required."}

First,\nACL authors are dramatically more likely to do work addressing social good\nconcerns when publishing in venues outside of ACL. Second, the vast majority of\npublications using NLP techniques to address concerns of social good are done\nby non-ACL authors in venues outside of ACL. We discuss the implications of\nthese findings on agenda-setting considerations for the ACL community related\nto NLP4SG."}

To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a\nlarge-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality\nperception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large\namount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and\nredundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.\nTo cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and\nsystematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning\ndataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first\ninvestigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different\nsizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data\nset randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than\ntraining with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the\nredundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly\nsampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with\nthree stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and\ncluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each\nstage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for\nexplainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can\nachieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%\nselected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs while achieving better performance."}

Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)\nmodels, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,\ngeneralize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.\nWhile recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple \"thinking\" from\n\"acting\", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action\nmodule. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.\nConsequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly\ncollected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation\nmechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a\ngeneralizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an\nintermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning\ncapabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module.

To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function\nthat integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized\nflare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This\napproach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that\npenalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the\nprediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during\nmodel optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,\nwe aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal\ncharacteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance."}

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,\nespecially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the\nsearch distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses\nprobability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single\nhigh-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking\npersists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework\nfor LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning\ndynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by\nblock-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token\ndistributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely\nconvergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,\nSwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying\nproblem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,\nSwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across\nreasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under\nconstrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,\nwith larger gains as budgets tighten."}

This\ncapability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this\npaper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a\nvideo generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images\nas the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large\npretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but\nalso the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal\nconsistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that\nexplicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target\nframe is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing\ntrajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable\ntransformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to\navoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video.

Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted\nfrontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To\naddress this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.\nFirst, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively\ncoordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization\nstrategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary\nSLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX.

We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into\nthe role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper\nmechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training\ntheir visual encoder and language model components."}

The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing\npre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble\nvoting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating\npredictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy\nrates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are\n90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%.

This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and\nbecause mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters\nappear cartoonish or vice versa.
