Considering the impressive\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive\nplanning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective\ngoal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented\nconversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to\ndialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate\ninformation in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part\ninformational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating\nintermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational\ncomponents corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible\nconfigurations for these informational components lead to limited information\nstates. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information\nstates and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.\nEventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is\nimplemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database\nqueries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of\nretrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables\npassing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of\ncongruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,\nwith no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and\nsuccess, and improvement compared with previous methods."}

In this work, we propose \"ArchitectHead\", the first framework for\ncreating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our\nkey idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose\na UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode\ntheir latent features.

This method\nenables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.\nExperimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nquality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while\nmaintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs.

Inspired by the recent\nsuccess of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose\nHOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task\nwithout any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process\nand HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

The performance gap stems from the fact that\nautoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered\npoint sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local\npredictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a\ncoarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at\nlow resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher\nscales through a next-scale prediction paradigm.

To achieve superior feature\nlearning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D\nprior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a\nnovel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature\nspace by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results\nin significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for\nunsupervised 3D instance segmentation.

Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains.

These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute\ngain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under\ndata-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will\nrelease our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further\nresearch."}

The framework has two key components: (i) a\nreasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of\ntext-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization\nprocess driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function\ndesigned to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our\napproach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for\nlanguage-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include\nimportant relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality\ndictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our\napproach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our\nexperiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two\ncommon failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited\none-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning\nwith Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing\nprior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our\nreward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human\nevaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely\naligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%\n(relative)."}

To\nenhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image\nsynthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a\nphenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs\nand can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we\nexplore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image\ngeneration. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that\nencourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI\nrewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to\nan estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a\nreinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while\nmaintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks\n(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates\nverbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts\nthat are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves\ncomputational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of\ngenerated images."}
