Although graph-based methods offer greater representational\nadaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational\ncomplexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the\nHeterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently\nleverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively\nbalancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency.

We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset.

MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging\nAttributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color\nand texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a\nwide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural\nScenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack\nfar exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and\ncategories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first\ntime; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of\nmultispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone\nmeticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive\nevaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral\ndata in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,\nhighlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field.

In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy.

We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and\nleave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across\nboth latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures.

To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance.

It provides questions across four\nincreasingly complex categories of business queries: descriptive, explanatory,\npredictive, and recommendational. This challenge calls for causal reasoning,\ntemporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level and\nmulti-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops on\nhigh-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer\nactionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about\n21\\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap between\npopular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence. We release a\npublic dataset and evaluation framework, and a website for public submissions."}

Vibe check is tied to real-world\nhuman preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,\nread cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code\nevaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,\noverlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this\npaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece\nunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides\nfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following\ncapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30\nverifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic\nverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,\nresulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following\nand functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even\nthe strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit\nclear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional\ncorrectness and instruction following correlates the best with human\npreference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on\nreal-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe\ncheck, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that\nbetter align with user preferences in coding."}

Inspired by the\nMulti-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of\nartificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the\nTransformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module\ntermed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses\nout-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To\nvalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like\narchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive\nexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate\nthat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and\nachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while\nsubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,\naugmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%\nand memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k\nsequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

However, while exhibiting a high degree of\nstructural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced\nstorytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs\noften fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated\nCML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup\nLanguage (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,\nhigh-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the\ncontent. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity\nand narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three\npivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character\nConsistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we\npropose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.\nCML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written\nscripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated\nby LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a\nprompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event\nlogic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound\nscripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and\ndemonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality\nscreenplays, with results aligned with human preferences."}
