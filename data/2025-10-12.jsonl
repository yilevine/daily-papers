This paper will present a\nreal-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing\naugmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study\nemploys RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature\nfusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between\nsynthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the\ndetection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most\nreliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap\nbetween synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined\nend-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and\naccuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to\nbalance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and\naccuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime\ndetection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under\npractical limits.

(i) While the emphasis is on\nsubject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for\nproducing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely\nunexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a\nsingle model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,\nhowever, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the\nbetter video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our\nsecond innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that\ntracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object\nfidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve\nstronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the\nmodel level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval\nas a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic\ncamera motion."}

To\naddress this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel\nweak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by\ntransferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two\nbranches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.\nThrough an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages\nlocal similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch.

Probing experiments suggest a\nstrong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the\nmodel appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To\nmitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a\nprocess-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory\nagainst problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,\ncalibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage\nrigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,\nRRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across\nfour math benchmarks.

Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such\nerrors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively\nmodifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned\nparameters under a rotation constraint.

Most existing analyses are limited to\nsuperficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner\nworkings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'\nthought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking\nissue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on\nsimple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose\nthe thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring\ndiscourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought\nprogression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for\ntopically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for\nopen-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing.

Deep learning (DL) based\nsegmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting\nand delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.\nAchieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as\nradiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.\nHowever, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to\nCT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities\nmeasure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper\nchallenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows\nthat they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we\npropose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that\nexploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random\nwindowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly\nincreases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.\nWe perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and\ncompare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on\nthe challenge of liver tumor segmentation."}

Equal contribution from\n  the first four authors", "summary": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their\nadoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language\nprocessing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes\ntheir deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite\ntheir efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following\ncapabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic\nuser requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by\ninducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability\nfor unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual\nInstruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual\npre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for\nbusiness conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that\nrely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and\nresponses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling\nbetter instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nDACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of\nbusiness conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item\ngeneration, and call purpose identification.

Building on this study, we\nanalyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified\nmodeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video\nediting capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the\nconstraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating\nmodality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and\nvideo editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance."}

This creates a fundamental tension between two competing\nchallenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,\nand a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current\napproaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely\nreject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music\nentirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance\nfor queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we\npropose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that\nformulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL\njointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is\nincentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and\nhelpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a\nDynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the\nconversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or\noverrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than\ndiscarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent\nand only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency\non safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,\ndemonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,\nfrom 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on\nOR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and\nfeedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances\nLLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto\nfront between helpfulness and harmlessness."}

These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning.

In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and\nMemorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with\nspatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather\nthan direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,\nwe integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention\nobjective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming\nsetting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory\nmechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and\ndelete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,\nshowing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on\nthe T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,\npractical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment\nfor compositional video generation on the fly."}

For\nvision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential\nmappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the\n\\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts\npsycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological\nsign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring\nmeaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$\nstate-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the\nNetherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \\textit{phonological form\nprediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below\nhuman performance; on \\textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;\nand only top models correlate moderately with human \\textit{iconicity ratings}.\nInterestingly, \\textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction\ncorrelate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity\nto visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks\nand motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling\niconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models."}

We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting\nmodel that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing\ngradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error\nserves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn\neffective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen\ndata distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize\nthe recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that\noperates in a $16 \\times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \\times$ fewer\nGaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models.

Project page: https://davidhalladay.github.io/diysink_demo", "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful\narchitectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and\ntextual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also\npropose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how\nthis information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly\nutilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range\nof LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT\nattention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning."}

We prove that pretrained networks exhibit\na universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral\nbalance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably\nsimilar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,\ntask relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,\nwhich provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning\n(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT\nmethod that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices\nof the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based\napproaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art\nPEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving\ntraining speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness.

We identify that this limitation stems from a critical\ngap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without\nestablishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To\naddress this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building\nspatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a\nmultimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,\nsingle image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed\nthrough a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across\nmodalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive\ntraining framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object\nlocalization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional\nspatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning\nwith verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning\nbenchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing\nGPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%.
