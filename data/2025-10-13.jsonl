To\nbridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world\nbusiness data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP\nscenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root\nSystem (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and\nHeart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex\nbranches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models\nstruggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three\nkey error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;\n(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and\n(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under\ncomplex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP\ntasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for\nimproving model capabilities.

Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating\nlarge volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality\nand cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation\nand training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a\nmultilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique\napproach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset\n(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using\nunique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,\nthis dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,\nbilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This\ntechnique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct\nmodel for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon\nthe pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks.

However, existing\nreasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often\ntreating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce\nBLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging\nperceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require\nmodels to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from\nlanguage-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception\nbenchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception (\"see\") and requires\nfine-grained observation and analytical reasoning (\"observe\"). BLINK-Twice\nintegrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing\nvisual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on\nvisual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of\nthe reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading\nMLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.\nBLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing\nreasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or\nself-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and\nredundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves\nperformance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by\nmodels like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.\nThe dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/PicoTrex/BLINK-Twice"}

We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:\ncompositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying\ncomplex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate\nrepresentations through iterative application of inference rules. In the\nliterature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella\nterm of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the\nlogical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)\nusing the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.\nThough simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of\nformal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning\nabilities.

Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for\nthinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a\n\"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate\n\"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor\neliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.\nExperiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing\nthink-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to\nmodels that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically\nreducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and\nattains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work\neffectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time\ninteraction."}

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains."}

Inspired by\nthis success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet\ntheir impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we\nintroduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.\nEvaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and\ninference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the\nfast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is\ntreated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual\nprocess. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel\nparadigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex\nperception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling\nperception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with\nreinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception\naccuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,\nand generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data\nare purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent\ngains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis\nreveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the\nmodel's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released."}

However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object\nhallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input\nimage. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key\nfactor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found\nthat there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic\nuncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show\ntheoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that\nexhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations\nindicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a\nsimple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the\nVE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for\nidentifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these\nuncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers\nof the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating\nhallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly\nreduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other\nprior arts."}

Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3\nand Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite\nexhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in\nunderstanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric\nfigures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting\nvisual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this\ninsight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that\nbridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial\nimprovements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves\nfrom 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to\n73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric\ncaptioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated\nfigure-caption pairs.

Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100.
