Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form.

Many mathematical\nproblems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion\nsuch as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models\n(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their\nconjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or\nproof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this\ngap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the\nevaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing\ncapabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation\npipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is\nsubstantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during\nevaluation.

However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three\nconundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation\nshift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise\nsub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This\ndecoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the\nfeature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between\nstage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across\nall classes.

Traditional prototype-based methods rely on\ndeterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations\nthat fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.\nThis work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that\nreformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space\nexploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement\nmodule that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via\nforward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism\nthat leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,\nand (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while\nmaximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference\nconsistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both\nphases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final\nrepresentations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself\nacts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets\ndemonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation."}

Through an\nagent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines\nvideo-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is\ngathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal\nunderstanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In\naddition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.\nEgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand\ncomplex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in\nextremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nVideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,\nachieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as\nGPT-4o.

Existing approaches to\nimproving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such\nas prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These\nworks treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does\nthe LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,\nparticularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a\nprobing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe\nthree findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest\nas latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often\namplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,\nwe propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a\nframework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level\nknowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,\nand (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to\naccurately integrate retrieved evidence.

We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns.

The\nchallenge is based on a new test set based on the well known RSBlur dataset.\nPairs of blur and degraded images in this dataset are captured using a\ndouble-camera system. Participant were tasked with developing solutions to\neffectively deblur these type of images while fulfilling strict efficiency\nconstraints: fewer than 5 million model parameters and a computational budget\nunder 200 GMACs. A total of 71 participants registered, with 4 teams finally\nsubmitting valid solutions. The top-performing approach achieved a PSNR of\n31.1298 dB, showcasing the potential of efficient methods in this domain.

Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In\naddition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for\ngeneration, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits\ntremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image\nediting, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating\nthe unified encoder design of UniFusion."}

The key idea behind our\nmethod is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image\ncompression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic\ncomplexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between\nthe responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we\nintroduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that\nautomatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.\nCompared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the\nnumber of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically\nadapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of\nvision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,\nand OCR capabilities.

In face of these challenges, we\nintroduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.\nOur CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable\nsingle-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly\nlearned.

To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a\n680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly\noutperforms BEV and VLA baselines.

On\nbenchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or\nexceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot\nsetting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use\nspecial tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the\nmodel's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate\nprediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate\nhigh-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically\nrich supervision for training; \\3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage\ntraining process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with\nGRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages\ngeometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous\ncoordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable\nbehaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature\nof the initial SFT stage.

To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction.

However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an\ninherent \"co-growth\" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To\naddress this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline\nintegrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally\nhallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset.
