This requires\nbuilding high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be\nsafely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering\nmethods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering\nspeeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to\napplications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.\nMulti-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle\ncross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the\nexpense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first\nmethod capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in\nreal-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera\nmodels, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary\nspinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor\ninconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and\nanchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%\ncompared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing\napproaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles\na wider range of camera models).

Many deep learning\nmethods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they\noften struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the\ntraining setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of\ndisease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and\nenvironment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative\nto task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning\nframework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),\ngrounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a\nlimited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and\nleverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess\nTMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset\ncomprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21\ndiseases and healthy instances across three crop species.

This paper presents the first\nlarge-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation\ngeneration by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically\nevaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A\nkey novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion\ndataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324\ndisinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four\nmajor languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic\ndimensions (country, generation, political orientation).

Intuitively, models trained in one environment\noften struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological\nconditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising\nperformance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization\nTest-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess\nintrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,\nwhich remain consistent across different regions regardless of external\nconditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for\nguiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust\nparameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance\nin new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.\nSpecifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic\ncharacteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the\nmodel during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to\nadapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses\nderived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order\nvariation.

This paper presents the first\nstudy of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM\n(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated\nFAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated\ncounterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).\n  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector\nsuch as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated\nV-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the\nFAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.\nHowever, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its\nFPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy\nefficiency (up to 3.1$\\times$ and 1.4$\\times$ improvements, respectively) than\nthe GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable\nrun-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in\n2 out of 5 dataset sequences.

To address these limitations, this study\npresents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition\nframework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main\nmodules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion\nstrategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal\nrelationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model\nextracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both\nlocal and global visual representations from video frames.

To address these challenges, we used a\nthinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline\ngraphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200\nstroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to\ndevelop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining\nU-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated\non a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.\nFurther, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA\nvariants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect\nsubtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed\ngraph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node\ndistance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features\nsuch as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong\nrobustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above\n0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization\ncombined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline\nextraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based\nmeasures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset\nand baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development\nand clinical research."}

To address\nthis issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a\nrepresentation for guiding video generation models to enhance their\nphysics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper\nsupervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance\nmotivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to\nphysical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation\nmodels to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for\nimproving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,\nproving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging\nphysical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions\nfor various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement\nlearning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware\nvideo generation and broader applications."}

Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly\nEnglish-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.\nTo evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text\nsettings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight\nvision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the\nfine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across\nEnglish, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,\ncurated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image\ncategories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language\nresources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and\nrationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover\nperformance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent\nagents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship\nunderstanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best\nperforming model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human\nperformance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap\nhighlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle\nmulti-modal visual reasoning."}

Although\nhybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks\nwithin unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs\nlimit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal\nretrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal\nfoundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow\nparadigms.

Recent\nwork has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in\n(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding\nobjectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that\ndrive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding\narises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal\nanalysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer\ncomputations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where\nattention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of\nlinguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across\narchitectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional\nLSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol\ngrounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for\npredicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation."}
