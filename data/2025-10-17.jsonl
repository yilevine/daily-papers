Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model.

In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few\ntokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model\nactivations produces text similar to the format and general content of the\nfinetuning data.

Today's PEFT\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively\nfine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or\ntextual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to\nhighlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment.

We formally prove the near-universality of\nthis scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On\nthis basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding\nediting approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an\ninversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization.

The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point\nDescriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual\nkeypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from\nthese descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or\nkeypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions\nthat situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available\ndataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully\ncurated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from\nmultiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from\nscene-level context to visual features around the keypoint.

In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives.

To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages\ntemporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to\n4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of\ncorrespondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train\na dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,\nfacilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from\nthe static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to\nrecover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the\ncorrespondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling\nfully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework\nachieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across\nmultiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,\nand point tracking.

First, a Visual Manipulation\nstage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M\ncaption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing\ntrajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.\nSecond, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on\nMathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual\nreasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To\nfacilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging\nbenchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved\nvisual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this\nframework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on\nMathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math\nbenchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and\nbenchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project\nPage: https://mathcanvas.github.io/"}
