SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic\nlearning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from\nvideo-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for\nhuman-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both\nprompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph\ngeneration and action localization benchmarks.

Prior\nwork on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer\ninteraction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and\nlongitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large\nlanguage models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of\nTrust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)\nspanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a\nrepresentative sample were combined with classification models to scale\nanalysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with\nshifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability\ndominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason\nshaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,\nexperts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological\nframework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public\nperceptions of GenAI."}

A\nstraightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we\nshow that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we\npropose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a\npretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free\nmethod interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.\nThis guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we\nexperiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for\nappearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach\nsuccessfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,\noutperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show\nthat traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their\ninability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in\nabsence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with\na GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like\nassessment, as further confirmed by our user study.

A promising approach is to reconstruct\nvisual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a\nlatent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct\nimages. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more\nsimilar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based\nspace or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the\ngenerative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of\nvisual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and\nrelationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that\nProjects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate\nrepresentation for visual stimuli reconstruction.

To address these challenges, we introduce a generic\nneuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is\nencoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes\nthis encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a\nreliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,\nwe demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while\nmaintaining trustworthiness.

Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index\nEmbedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference\nimages; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature\ncontainer to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).\nThe identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token\nrepresentations toward independently representing the features of each\nidentity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the\ncapabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,\nenabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background\nreconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in\nmulti-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first\nopen-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation\ndataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference\nsubjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for\nmultiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art\nmodels in multiple reference image generation task.

This has created a void in the\nunderstanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive\nimages. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our\nfindings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,\nPreference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,\na PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained\ncounterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of\nstandard vision pretraining.

This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing\nstages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as\nhealthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on\nerror-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and\nhallucinations.

This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain\ndeeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to\nrevolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of\ncardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in\ncardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find\narticles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range\nof different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,\nwe identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from\nmultiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,\ncardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals\nconsiderable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the\nconsiderable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a\ntemporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP\nmethods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the\nreview constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in\ncardiology to date."}

Our\nevaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable\nto real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but\ndiffering roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as\npatients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced\nknowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates\nhow implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a\nmethodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI."}

In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%.

Through a unified\nframework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination\nof three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk\nEncoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;\n(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information\nwithout it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced\nselection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution\ngap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing\nand landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new\nstate-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully\ngeneralizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and\nBABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design\nprinciples for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models."}

This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition.

Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,\ntask-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and\nlimited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework\nfor video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically\ncombining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine\nlearning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video\nunderstanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a\nhigh-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms\na video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual\nencoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal\nSegmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the\ncontinuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.\nThese segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to\nidentify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By\nselecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging\nthe VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework\nautomatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.\nThis approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway\nfor zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content."}

QV-M$^2$ consists\nof 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing\nefforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we\npropose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment\nboundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently\nleverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through\nthis sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and\nrobust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing\nMR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.\nResults show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and\nevaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,\non QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,\n2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method\nestablish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging\nvideo temporal grounding scenarios.

Deep learning-based\nsegmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)\nvisual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited\nlabeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation\nframework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using\nhigh-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs\novercome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath\nvegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV\nintroduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on\nknowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual\nand geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting\nvarious vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision\nTransformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj\nBim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of\ncolonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves\na mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains\n63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results\ndemonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM\nderivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich\nenvironments with scarce annotations."}

We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA\nmodels achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while\nbeing 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on\nWindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming\nbaselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,\nreducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency."}

Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a\nframework that renders long texts into images and processes them with\nvision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal\ntasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at\nhttps://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph."}

However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong\nediting strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation\nbecomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual\nerrors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global\nconsistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as\ntexture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.\nRecently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant\nimprovements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for\nintegrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for\novercoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an\nin-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention\nmechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention\ncontrol method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates\nvision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and\ndifferentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce\nconsistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image\nand video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and\nstructure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first\napproach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers\nwithout handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which\nenables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports\nprogressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control."}

While these methods improve visual\nquality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To\nsystematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,\nwe introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating\nsocial representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias\ntaxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to\ndisentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes\n(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to\nevaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,\n(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)\nthe temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we\nconduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference\ndatasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through\nalignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment\ntuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them\ntemporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These\nfindings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout\nthe alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation."}
