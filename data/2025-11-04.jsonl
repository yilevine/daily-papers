While such models support users in a variety of creative\ntasks, they lack the embodied nature of human interaction. Dance, as a primal\nform of human expression, is predestined to complement this experience. To\nexplore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an\ninteractive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data. It generates an\nartificial other by partially mimicking and also \"creatively\" enhancing an\nincoming sequence of movement data. It is the first model, which leverages\nsingle-person motion data and high level features in order to do so and, thus,\nit does not rely on low level human-human interaction data. It combines ideas\nof two diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to\ngenerate movement representations that are both temporally coherent and\nresponsive to a chosen movement reference. The success of the model is\ndemonstrated by quantitatively assessing the convergence of the feature\ndistribution of the generated samples and the test set which serves as\nsimulating the human performer. We show that our generations are first steps to\ncreative dancing with AI as they are both diverse showing various deviations\nfrom the human partner while appearing realistic."}

In this work, we are the first\nto introduce this factor in the evaluation of DP text privatization, where we\ndesign utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets with dynamic split\nsizes. We run these tests on datasets of varying size with up to one million\ntexts, and we focus on quantifying the effect of increasing dataset size on the\nprivacy-utility trade-off. Our findings reveal that dataset size plays an\nintegral part in evaluating DP text rewriting mechanisms; additionally, these\nfindings call for more rigorous evaluation procedures in DP NLP, as well as\nshed light on the future of DP NLP in practice and at scale."}

An emerging line of research to address such\nthreats focuses on implanting \"protective\" adversarial noise into images before\ntheir public release, so future attempts to edit them using text-to-image\nmodels can be impeded. However, subsequent works have shown that these\nadversarial noises are often easily \"reversed,\" e.g., with techniques as simple\nas JPEG compression, casting doubt on the practicality of the approach. In this\npaper, we argue that adversarial noise for image protection should not only be\nimperceptible, as has been a primary focus of prior work, but also\nirreversible, viz., it should be difficult to detect as noise provided that the\noriginal image is hidden. We propose a surprisingly simple method to enhance\nthe robustness of image protection methods against noise reversal techniques.\nSpecifically, it applies an adaptive per-region Gaussian blur on the noise to\nadjust the overall frequency spectrum. Through extensive experiments, we show\nthat our method consistently improves the per-sample worst-case protection\nperformance of existing methods against a wide range of reversal techniques on\ndiverse image editing scenarios, while also reducing quality degradation due to\nnoise in terms of perceptual metrics.

Yet, automating urban\nmonitoring remains difficult because curated datasets of specific urban\nfeatures and their changes are scarce. We introduce OSMGen, a generative\nframework that creates realistic satellite imagery directly from raw\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Unlike prior work that relies on raster tiles, OSMGen\nuses the full richness of OSM JSON, including vector geometries, semantic tags,\nlocation, and time, giving fine-grained control over how scenes are generated.\nA central feature of the framework is the ability to produce consistent\nbefore-after image pairs: user edits to OSM inputs translate into targeted\nvisual changes, while the rest of the scene is preserved. This makes it\npossible to generate training data that addresses scarcity and class imbalance,\nand to give planners a simple way to preview proposed interventions by editing\nmap data. More broadly, OSMGen produces paired (JSON, image) data for both\nstatic and changed states, paving the way toward a closed-loop system where\nsatellite imagery can automatically drive structured OSM updates.

We\nintroduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that\ninjects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical\ncomplexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N. VCA first distils each head's\ndense query field into a handful of spatially pooled visual-contrast tokens,\nthen splits them into a learnable positive and negative stream whose\ndifferential interaction highlights what truly separates one region from\nanother. The module adds fewer than 0.3M parameters to a DeiT-Tiny backbone,\nrequires no extra FLOPs, and is wholly architecture-agnostic. Empirically, VCA\nlifts DeiT-Tiny top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K from 72.2% to 75.6% (+3.4) and\nimproves three strong hierarchical ViTs by up to 3.1%, while in\nclass-conditional ImageNet generation it lowers FID-50K by 2.1 to 5.2 points\nacross both diffusion (DiT) and flow (SiT) models.

Visually-augmented reasoning for verbal generation\nevaluates whether models can generate intermediate visualizations that\nstrengthen their own reasoning processes for question answering. Experiments on\n17 unified models reveal two key findings: (i) Cross-modal reasoning determines\nvisual generation quality, with interleaved models significantly outperforming\nnon-interleaved ones; notably, combining strong unimodal models fails to\nachieve comparable reasoning. (ii) Models show dissociation between physical\nand symbolic reasoning: they succeed at interpreting perceptual concepts\nliterally but fail to construct visual abstractions for symbolic tasks, where\nfaulty reasoning harms performance. These results highlight reciprocal\ncross-modal reasoning as a critical frontier for enabling true omnimodal\ngeneration."}

In this paper, we investigate how to\neffectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,\nthrough extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an\neffective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,\ninstead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been\noptimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL.

Our approach creates a\nsymbolic knowledge graph from text data by encoding entities and factual\nrelationships as structured facts triples. We use LLMs selectively during\nonline retrieval to perform semantic filtering and answer generation. We also\nuse entity-guided graph traversal through Personalized PageRank (PPR) to\nsupport efficient, scalable retrieval based on the knowledge graph we built.\nOur system gets state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA,\nwith F1 scores of 80.7% and 78.9%, and Recall@5 scores of 97.1% and 98.1%,\nrespectively. These results show that prompt design is an important part of\nimproving retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research lays the\ngroundwork for more efficient and comprehensible multi-hop question-answering\nsystems, highlighting the importance of prompt-aware graph reasoning."}

Textures of clouds\nand waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and\nlandscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We\npresent the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and\nvisual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the\nmodels and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different\nmodels and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry,\nbiology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way\nto explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and\nthe mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that\nautonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use\nSciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual\npatterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different\npatterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer\nand recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image\nof a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the\nmechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated\nimage that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that\nvision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system\nbeyond a visual pattern.

Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced\ncapability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current\nthinking-\\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as\nlocalization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic,\nand tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \\textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks,\neach requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in\nchain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from\nleading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use\naugmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and\nstrong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally,\nwe present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning."}

Prior arts have focused on various\nfeature extraction and architectural changes to support neural machine\ntranslation for sign languages. We propose POSESTITCH-SLT, a novel pre-training\nscheme that is inspired by linguistic-templates-based sentence generation\ntechnique. With translation comparison on two sign language datasets, How2Sign\nand iSign, we show that a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture\noutperforms the prior art when considering template-generated sentence pairs in\ntraining. We achieve BLEU-4 score improvements from 1.97 to 4.56 on How2Sign\nand from 0.55 to 3.43 on iSign, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods for\npose-based gloss-free translation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of\ntemplate-driven synthetic supervision in low-resource sign language settings."}
