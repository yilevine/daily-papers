Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue but lacks reliable mechanisms for updating or refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose TeleMem, a unified long-term and multimodal memory system that maintains coherent user profiles through narrative dynamic extraction, ensuring that only dialogue-grounded information is preserved. TeleMem further introduces a structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries, substantially improving storage efficiency, reducing token usage, and accelerating memory operations. Additionally, a multimodal memory module combined with ReAct-style reasoning equips the system with a closed-loop observe, think, and act process that enables accurate understanding of complex video content in long-term contexts. Experimental results show that TeleMem surpasses the state-of-the-art Mem0 baseline with 19% higher accuracy, 43% fewer tokens, and a 2.1x speedup on the ZH-4O long-term role-play gaming benchmark."}

We argue this failure stems from training paradigms that overlook the dynamic interplay of a character's internal world. Current approaches, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fact-based priming, literature-based learning, and synthetic data generation, exhibit recurring limitations in modeling the deliberative, value-conflicted reasoning that defines human interaction. In this paper, we identify four core concepts essential for character authenticity: Values, Experiences, Judgments, and Abilities (VEJA). We propose the VEJA framework as a new paradigm for data curation that addresses these systemic limitations. To illustrate the qualitative ceiling enabled by our framework, we present a pilot study comparing a manually curated, VEJA-grounded dataset against a state-of-the-art synthetic baseline. Using an LLM-as-judge evaluation, our findings demonstrate a significant quality gap, suggesting that a shift toward conceptually grounded data curation, as embodied by VEJA, is necessary for creating roleplaying agents with genuine depth and narrative continuity.

We undertook Vacaspati and IndicCorp, which are the most extensive literature and newspaper-only corpora for Bangla. We examine key linguistic properties, including the type-token ratio (TTR), hapax legomena ratio (HLR), Bigram diversity, average syllable and word lengths, and adherence to Zipfs Law, for both newspaper (IndicCorp) and literary corpora (Vacaspati).For all the features, such as Bigram Diversity and HLR, despite its smaller size, the literary corpus exhibits significantly higher lexical richness and structural variation. Additionally, we tried to understand the diversity of corpora by building n-gram models and measuring perplexity. Our findings reveal that literary corpora have higher perplexity than newspaper corpora, even for similar sentence sizes. This trend can also be observed for the English newspaper and literature corpus, indicating its generalizability. We also examined how the perfor- mance of models on downstream tasks is influenced by the inclusion of literary data alongside newspaper data. Our findings suggest that inte- grating literary data with newspapers improves the performance of models on various downstream tasks. We have also demonstrated that a literary corpus adheres more closely to global word distribution proper- ties, such as Zipfs law, than a newspaper corpus or a merged corpus of both literary and newspaper texts. Literature corpora also have higher entropy and lower redundancy values compared to a newspaper corpus. We also further assess the readability using Flesch and Coleman-Liau in- dices, showing that literary texts are more complex."}

We introduce a sample-level, soft reinforcement learning compression method that penalizes inefficiently long rollouts, but only on problems where the model has already mastered and already produced a more concise rollout. Our experiments show that this method reduces average response length by 20-40% with comparable or higher accuracy. Crucially, the compression exhibits strong cross-domain generalization; a model trained on math spontaneously shortens responses on unseen tasks like code, instruction following, and general knowledge QA, with stable or improved accuracy. We demonstrate a stable post-training curriculum (accuracy-compression-accuracy) that can ultimately produce models that are more accurate and reason more concisely, arguing that such compression method should be a standard phase in developing efficient reasoning models."}

A topology prior complements Dice/BCE in two forms: (i) persistent-homology (PH) distance for evaluation and selection, and (ii) a differentiable surrogate that combines a soft Euler-characteristic match with total variation regularization for stable training. I introduce warm-ups for both the hyperbolic contrastive term and the topology prior, per-sample evaluation of structure-aware metrics (Boundary-F1, Betti errors, PD distance), and a min-PD within top-K Dice rule for checkpoint selection. On a Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940), early results show consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while Dice/IoU remain competitive.

A typical approach connects a pretrained LLM with an audio encoder through a projection module and trains the resulting model on large-scale, task-specific instruction-tuning datasets. However, curating such instruction-tuning data for specific requirements is time-consuming, and models trained in this manner often generalize poorly to unseen tasks. In this work, we first formulate that the strongest generalization of a speech-LLM is achieved when it is trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT), in which supervision signals are generated by a frozen LLM using textual representations of speech as input. Our proposed SIFT paradigm eliminates the need for collecting task-specific question-answer pairs and yields the theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce AZeroS (Auden Zero-instruction-tuned Speech-LLM), which is trained on speech-text pairs derived from publicly available corpora, including approximately 25,000 hours of speech with ASR transcripts and 3,000 hours of speech with paralinguistic labels. Built upon Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the model updates only two lightweight projection modules (23.8 million parameters each), while keeping both the LLM and audio encoders frozen. Despite the minimal training cost and modest data scale, AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks, including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech)."}

Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient.

LLMs rely on tokenizers to segment text into these tokens, and tokenization is the primary determinant of computational and inference cost. Sanskrit, one of the oldest languages, is hypothesized to express more meaning per token due to its morphology and grammar rules; however, no prior work has quantified this. We use a dataset of 701 parallel verses of the Bhagavad Gita, which comprises three languages-Sanskrit, English, and Hindi along with transliteration of Sanskrit into English. We test tokenizers including SentencePiece (SPM), older GPT models, and the latest generation tokenizers from Gemini and GPT. We use metrics of token count, characters per token (token efficiency), and tokens per character (token cost). Results show a ~2x difference in token counts between Sanskrit and English/Hindi under the unbiased SPM baseline. English/Hindi translations of Sanskrit commentary resulted in an approximately 20x increase in token count. GPT o200k base (latest, used by GPT-4o) and Gemini (latest) reduce bias by a significant degree compared to GPT cl100k base (used until GPT-4), but still fail to fully capture Sanskrit's compactness. This matters because there might be a penalty bias for non-English users, which inflates the token count. This research provides a foundation for improving future tokenizer design and shows the potential of Sanskrit for highly compact encoding, saving on cost while speeding up training and inference.

To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption. Extensive experiments show that COVR achieves strong performance across various challenging visual control tasks."}

We introduce Amory, a working memory framework that actively constructs structured memory representations through enhancing agentic reasoning during offline time. Amory organizes conversational fragments into episodic narratives, consolidates memories with momentum, and semanticizes peripheral facts into semantic memory. At retrieval time, the system employs coherence-driven reasoning over narrative structures. Evaluated on the LOCOMO benchmark for long-term reasoning, Amory achieves considerable improvements over previous state-of-the-art, with performance comparable to full context reasoning while reducing response time by 50%. Analysis shows that momentum-aware consolidation significantly enhances response quality, while coherence-driven retrieval provides superior memory coverage compared to embedding-based approaches."}

In this work, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting framework and benchmark that evaluate how LLMs reason about mass spectral data to predict molecular structures.

As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality."}

Contrary to the common belief that this weakness is caused primarily by low rank, we show that LoRA's vulnerability is fundamentally spectral. Our analysis identifies two key factors: LoRA updates (i) possess insufficient spectral strength, with singular values far below those of pretrained weights, and (ii) exhibit unfavorable spectral alignment, weakly matching clean-task directions while retaining overlap with trigger-sensitive subspaces. We further establish a critical scaling threshold beyond which LoRA can theoretically suppress trigger-induced activations, and we show empirically that standard LoRA rarely reaches this regime. We introduce Regularized Low-Rank Adaptation (RoRA), which improves forgetting by increasing spectral strength and correcting alignment through clean-strengthened regularization, trigger-insensitive constraints, and post-training spectral rescaling. Experiments across multiple NLP benchmarks and attack settings show that RoRA substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy."}

This paper investigates the latent organization of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three complementary dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry. UMAP uncovers nonlinear manifolds that reflect smooth stylistic transitions between digit classes. Together, these results demonstrate that handwritten digits occupy a structured low-dimensional manifold and that different statistical frameworks expose complementary aspects of this structure."}

These expressions encode rich, cultural meaning, and have both figurative and literal meanings, making accurate translation difficult. Because models are fairly good at translating compositional text, we investigate GRPO-style fine-tuning using Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) models as reward functions to train models to better translate idioms. Using Chinese and Hindi idiom datasets, we find that idiom translation abilities improve by ~14 points, general, non-idiomatic translation implicitly improves by ~8 points, and cross-lingual translation abilities (trained on one language, evaluated on another) improves by ~6 points. Overall, our work quantifies the non-compositional translation gap and offers insights for developing LLMs with stronger cross-cultural and figurative language understanding."}

To address these challenges effectively, we propose TBDN, a training-free framework integrating two complementary closed-loop mechanisms: Hint Instruction (HI) and Query Contrastive Decoding (QCD). HI injects task-aware inductive bias via lightweight prompt engineering to anchor models on contextual mapping rules, thereby mitigating compliance failure. QCD adjusts the decoding distributions of language models by contrasting full-input and query-omitted distributions, suppressing prior-dominated hallucination. TBDN achieves State-of-the-Art performance on CoBSAT and Text-to-Image Fast Mini-ImageNet, with robust generalization across model backbones, prompt designs, and hyperparameters. It also maintains promising performance in concept preservation and prompt following on Dreambench++.

In this work, we introduce Warmth and Competence Sentences (W&C-Sent), the first sentence-level dataset annotated for warmth and competence. The dataset includes over 1,600 English sentence--target pairs annotated along three dimensions: trust and sociability (components of warmth), and competence. The sentences in W&C-Sent are from social media and often express attitudes and opinions about specific individuals or social groups (the targets of our annotations). We describe the data collection, annotation, and quality-control procedures in detail, and evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) on their ability to identify trust, sociability, and competence in text.

Existing solutions typically resort to a heavy \"data engineering\" paradigm-synthesizing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This pipeline primarily optimizes probability sampling efficiency and aligns output distributions, but fails to activate the intrinsic intelligence required for dynamic visual exploration. In this work, we propose TIR-Flow, a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from passive processing to active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updating. Concretely, our framework operates through three synergistic modules: HDD decomposes complex queries into a set of verifiable sub-tasks; HAP actively directs visual attention to gather high-resolution evidence for hypothesis validation; EBA maintains a persistent workspace to accumulate and update the discovered clues for logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines, delivering an average performance boost of 5.9%, with gains reaching 10.5% on Egoschema. Our analysis confirms that empowering frozen VLMs with System-2-like active perception is a scalable path toward solving long-horizon video reasoning."}

In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using ``global token perplexity'', which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline. Together, these results suggest that appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling."}

With the growing availability of online cooking videos, there is unprecedented potential to study such culinary variations using computational tools systematically. However, existing video understanding methods fail to capture the fine-grained, multimodal, and culturally grounded differences in procedural cooking videos. This work presents the first large-scale, curated dataset of biryani preparation videos, comprising 120 high-quality YouTube recordings across 12 distinct regional styles. We propose a multi-stage framework leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units and align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text. Building on these aligned representations, we introduce a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. We construct a comprehensive question-answer (QA) benchmark spanning multiple reasoning levels to evaluate procedural understanding in VLMs. Our approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles, incorporates human-in-the-loop verification for high-precision tasks, and benchmarks several state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The resulting dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos.

Here, we analyze topology of growing word-adjacency networks constructed from Chinese and English literary works written in different periods. Unconventionally, instead of considering dictionary words only, we also include punctuation marks as if they were ordinary words. Our approach is based on two arguments: (1) punctuation carries genuine information related to emotional state, allows for logical grouping of content, provides a pause in reading, and facilitates understanding by avoiding ambiguity, and (2) our previous works have shown that punctuation marks behave like words in a Zipfian analysis and, if considered together with regular words, can improve authorship attribution in stylometric studies. We focus on a functional dependence of the average shortest path length $L(N)$ on a network size $N$ for different epochs and individual novels in their original language as well as for translations of selected novels into the other language. We approximate the empirical results with a growing network model and obtain satisfactory agreement between the two. We also observe that $L(N)$ behaves asymptotically similar for both languages if punctuation marks are included but becomes sizably larger for Chinese if punctuation marks are neglected."}

Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring."}

Continued pre-training (CPT) offers a practical route to language adaptation, but improvements on demanding capabilities such as mathematical reasoning often remain limited. This limitation is driven in part by the uneven domain coverage and missing task-relevant knowledge that characterize many low-resource language corpora. We present \\texttt{AfriqueLLM}, a suite of open LLMs adapted to 20 African languages through CPT on 26B tokens. We perform a comprehensive empirical study across five base models spanning sizes and architectures, including Llama 3.1, Gemma 3, and Qwen 3, and systematically analyze how CPT data composition shapes downstream performance. In particular, we vary mixtures that include math, code, and synthetic translated data, and evaluate the resulting models on a range of multilingual benchmarks. Our results identify data composition as the primary driver of CPT gains. Adding math, code, and synthetic translated data yields consistent improvements, including on reasoning-oriented evaluations. Within a fixed architecture, larger models typically improve performance, but architectural choices dominate scale when comparing across model families. Moreover, strong multilingual performance in the base model does not reliably predict post-CPT outcomes; robust architectures coupled with task-aligned data provide a more dependable recipe. Finally, our best models improve long-context performance, including document-level translation.

This is useful in cases where the amount of data is large and labelling is expensive, such as in machine vision or medical imaging. Two particularities of machine vision are first, that most of the images produced are free of defects, and second, that the amount of images produced is so big that we cannot store all acquired images. This results, on the one hand, in a strong class imbalance in defect distribution and, on the other hand, in a potential label shift caused by limited storage. To understand how these two forms of imbalance affect active learning algorithms, we propose a simulation study based on two open-source datasets. We artificially create datasets for which we control the levels of class imbalance and label shift. Three standard active learning selection strategies are compared: random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection. We demonstrate that active learning strategies, and in particular the entropy-based and core-set selections, remain interesting and efficient even for highly imbalanced datasets. We also illustrate and measure the loss of efficiency that occurs in the situation a strong label shift."}

We introduce a decision-theoretic framework that resolves this trade-off through the Value of Information (VoI), enabling agents to dynamically weigh the expected utility gain from asking questions against the cognitive cost imposed on users. Our inference-time method requires no hyperparameter tuning and adapts seamlessly across contexts-from casual games to medical diagnosis. Experiments across four diverse domains (20 Questions, medical diagnosis, flight booking, and e-commerce) show that VoI consistently matches or exceeds the best manually-tuned baselines, achieving up to 1.36 utility points higher in high-cost settings.

Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance."}

To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency."}

This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces hallucination rates and effectively enhances the inference accuracy of MLLMs."}

To answer this, we propose a method that enables a language agent to give feedback to a vision-language model (VLM) to adapt text generation to the agent's preferences. Our results from different experiments affirm this hypothesis, showing that LLM preference feedback significantly enhances VLM descriptions. Using our proposed method, we find that the VLM can generate multimodal scene descriptions to help the LLM better understand multimodal context, leading to improvements of maximum 13% in absolute accuracy compared to the baseline multimodal approach. Furthermore, a human study validated our AI-driven feedback, showing a 64.6% preference alignment rate between the LLM's choices and human judgments. Extensive experiments provide insights on how and why the method works and its limitations."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a conditional generative framework for synthesizing realistic Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps. Our approach leverages a generative diffusion model to generate radar data for multiple object categories, including pedestrians, cars, and cyclists. Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \\SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation. These results indicate that our generative framework not only produces physically plausible and diverse radar spectrum but also substantially improves model generalization in downstream tasks."}

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on the content of model behavior, NC-Bench focuses on the form and structure of natural conversation. Grounded in the IBM Natural Conversation Framework (NCF), NC-Bench comprises three distinct sets. The Basic Conversation Competence set evaluates fundamental sequence management practices, such as answering inquiries, repairing responses, and closing conversational pairs. The RAG set applies the same sequence management patterns as the first set but incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The Complex Request set extends the evaluation to complex requests involving more intricate sequence management patterns. Each benchmark tests a model's ability to produce contextually appropriate conversational actions in response to characteristic interaction patterns. Initial evaluations across 6 open-source models and 14 interaction patterns show that models perform well on basic answering tasks, struggle more with repair tasks (especially repeat), have mixed performance on closing sequences, and find complex multi-turn requests most challenging, with Qwen models excelling on the Basic set and Granite models on the RAG set and the Complex Request set. By operationalizing fundamental principles of human conversation, NC-Bench provides a lightweight, extensible, and theory-grounded framework for assessing and improving the conversational abilities of LLMs beyond topical or task-specific benchmarks."}

The most problematic area to researchers in image processing and computer vision is the human face which is a complex object with myriads of distinctive features that can be used to identify the face. The survey of this survey is particularly focused on most challenging facial characteristics, including differences in the light, ageing, variation in poses, partial occlusion, and facial expression and presents methodological solutions. The factors, therefore, are inevitable in the creation of effective facial recognition mechanisms used on facial images. This paper reviews the most sophisticated methods of facial detection which are Hidden Markov Models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Elastic Cluster Plot Matching, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gabor Waves, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Eigenfaces, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and 3D Morphable Model. Alongside the works mentioned above, we have also analyzed the images of a number of facial databases, namely JAFEE, FEI, Yale, LFW, AT&T (then called ORL), and AR (created by Martinez and Benavente), to analyze the results. However, this survey is aimed at giving a thorough literature review of face recognition, and its applications, and some experimental results are provided at the end after a detailed discussion."}

We demonstrate that temporal information in their latent space is organized not as discrete clusters but as a continuous, traversable geometry. We introduce the Time Travel Engine (TTE), an interpretability-driven framework that projects diachronic linguistic patterns onto a shared chronological manifold. Unlike surface-level prompting, TTE directly modulates latent representations to induce coherent stylistic, lexical, and conceptual shifts aligned with target eras. By parameterizing diachronic evolution as a continuous manifold within the residual stream, TTE enables fluid navigation through period-specific \"zeitgeists\" while restricting access to future knowledge. Furthermore, experiments across diverse architectures reveal topological isomorphism between the temporal subspaces of Chinese and English-indicating that distinct languages share a universal geometric logic of historical evolution. These findings bridge historical linguistics with mechanistic interpretability, offering a novel paradigm for controlling temporal reasoning in neural networks."}

Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality.

Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces."}

Under review", "summary": "Warning: This paper consists of examples representing regional biases in Indian regions that might be offensive towards a particular region. While social biases corresponding to gender, race, socio-economic conditions, etc., have been extensively studied in the major applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), biases corresponding to regions have garnered less attention. This is mainly because of (i) difficulty in the extraction of regional bias datasets, (ii) disagreements in annotation due to inherent human biases, and (iii) regional biases being studied in combination with other types of social biases and often being under-represented. This paper focuses on creating a dataset IndRegBias, consisting of regional biases in an Indian context reflected in users' comments on popular social media platforms, namely Reddit and YouTube. We carefully selected 25,000 comments appearing on various threads in Reddit and videos on YouTube discussing trending topics on regional issues in India. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel annotation strategy to annotate the comments describing the severity of regional biased statements. To detect the presence of regional bias and its severity in IndRegBias, we evaluate open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Indic Language Models (ILMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning strategies. We observe that zero-shot and few-shot approaches show lower accuracy in detecting regional biases and severity in the majority of the LLMs and ILMs. However, the fine-tuning approach significantly enhances the performance of the LLM in detecting Indian regional bias along with its severity."}

Rather than modifying model architectures or optimization objectives, VideoWeave reorganizes available video-text pairs to expand temporal diversity within fixed compute. We systematically study how different data composition strategies like random versus visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment affect downstream performance on downstream video question answering. Under identical compute constraints, models trained with VideoWeave achieve higher accuracy than conventional video finetuning.

In this process, astronomers leverage specialized tools to analyze spectra and construct reliable catalogs. However, this practice has become the primary bottleneck, as it is fundamentally incapable of scaling with the data deluge from modern spectroscopic surveys. To bridge this gap, we propose Spec-o3, a tool-augmented vision-language agent that performs astronomer-aligned spectral inspection via interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. Spec-o3 is trained with a two-stage post-training recipe: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on expert inspection trajectories followed by outcome-based reinforcement learning on rare-type verification tasks. Evaluated on five rare-object identification tasks from LAMOST, Spec-o3 establishes a new State-of-the-Art, boosting the macro-F1 score from 28.3 to 76.5 with a 7B parameter base model and outperforming both proprietary VLMs and specialized deep models. Crucially, the agent demonstrates strong generalization to unseen inspection tasks across survey shifts (from LAMOST to SDSS/DESI). Expert evaluations confirm that its reasoning traces are coherent and physically consistent, supporting transparent and trustworthy decision-making.

Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining.

To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions. Finally, we leverage the large language model to classify this entire sequence of actions, together with the classroom context, as belonging to an engaged or disengaged student.

To address this gap, we establish WHU-PCPR, a cross-platform heterogeneous point cloud dataset designed for place recognition. The dataset differentiates itself from existing datasets through its distinctive characteristics: 1) cross-platform heterogeneous point clouds: collected from survey-grade vehicle-mounted Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems and low-cost Portable helmet-mounted Laser Scanning (PLS) systems, each equipped with distinct mechanical and solid-state LiDAR sensors. 2) Complex localization scenes: encompassing real-time and long-term changes in both urban and campus road scenes. 3) Large-scale spatial coverage: featuring 82.3 km of trajectory over a 60-month period and an unrepeated route of approximately 30 km. Based on WHU-PCPR, we conduct extensive evaluation and in-depth analysis of several representative PCPR methods, and provide a concise discussion of key challenges and future research directions.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating clear and executable code, making them powerful and suitable tools for writing SimPy queueing simulation code. However, directly employing closed-source models like GPT-4o to generate such code may lead to high computational costs and raise data privacy concerns. To address this, we fine-tune two open-source LLMs, Qwen-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, on curated SimPy queueing data, which enhances their code-generating performance in executability, output-format compliance, and instruction-code consistency. Particularly, we proposed a multi-stage fine-tuning framework comprising two stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and one stage of direct preference optimization (DPO), progressively enhancing the model's ability in SimPy-based queueing simulation code generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that both fine-tuned models achieve substantial improvements in executability, output-format compliance, and instruct consistency. These results confirm that domain-specific fine-tuning can effectively transform compact open-source code models into reliable SimPy simulation generators which provide a practical alternative to closed-source LLMs for education, research, and operational decision support."}

While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \\textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \\textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of improving the adversarial robustness of 3D VLMs, especially as they are deployed in safety-critical applications."}

Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language.

Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability."}

Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead."}

These losses constrain flow predictions using masks and gradients computed via difference or Sobel operator.

We study this question by measuring (1) the directional change ($θ$) between the truth vectors with and without context and (2) the relative magnitude of the truth vectors upon adding context. Across four LLMs and four datasets, we find that (1) truth vectors are roughly orthogonal in early layers, converge in middle layers, and may stabilize or continue increasing in later layers; (2) adding context generally increases the truth vector magnitude, i.e., the separation between true and false representations in the activation space is amplified; (3) larger models distinguish relevant from irrelevant context mainly through directional change ($θ$), while smaller models show this distinction through magnitude differences. We also find that context conflicting with parametric knowledge produces larger geometric changes than parametrically aligned context.

In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s.

In this paper, we present a sampling-based framework to estimate the NEL accuracy of large-scale IE corpora under statistical guarantees and constrained annotation budgets. We frame NEL accuracy estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize expected annotation cost subject to a target Margin of Error (MoE) for the corpus-level accuracy estimate. Building on recent works on knowledge graph accuracy estimation, we adapt Stratified Two-Stage Cluster Sampling (STWCS) to the NEL setting, defining label-based strata and global surface-form clusters in a way that is independent of NEL annotations. Applied to 11,184 NEL annotations in GutBrainIE -- a new biomedical corpus openly released in fall 2025 -- our framework reaches a MoE $\\leq 0.05$ by manually annotating only 2,749 triples (24.6%), leading to an overall accuracy estimate of $0.915 \\pm 0.0473$. A time-based cost model and simulations against a Simple Random Sampling (SRS) baseline show that our design reduces expert annotation time by about 29% at fixed sample size. The framework is generic and can be applied to other NEL benchmarks and IE pipelines that require scalable and statistically robust accuracy assessment."}

Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data. We further introduce Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation, and integrate it into GLOWDeblur, a Generalizable reaL-wOrld lightWeight Deblur model that combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment module with a lightweight diffusion backbone. Extensive experiments on six widely-used benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate our approach, confirming the importance of blur priors for robust generalization and demonstrating that the lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practicality in real-world applications.

State-of-the-art methods demonstrate strong performance when trained and tested within the same domain. However, they struggle to generalise to new environments due to limited training data and depth perception -- overfitting to specific camera intrinsics. Our method addresses this by estimating keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space, normalised by focal length and image size, enabling camera-agnostic depth prediction. We further leverage this invariance to camera intrinsics to propose a self-supervised test-time optimisation strategy that refines the model's depth perception during inference. This is achieved by applying a 3D consistency loss between predicted and in-space scale-transformed hand poses, allowing the model to adapt to target domain characteristics without requiring ground truth annotations. V-HPOT significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios, achieving a 71% reduction in mean pose error on the H2O dataset and a 41% reduction on the AssemblyHands dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, V-HPOT outperforms all single-stage approaches across all datasets and competes closely with two-stage methods, despite needing approximately x3.5 to x14 less data."}

We measure susceptibility via Bias Trap Rate--probability of misdiagnosing traps despite correctly diagnosing controls.

Thus, we propose ECR-Agent, aligning LLM reasoning with Evidence-Based Medicine standard via two components: (1) Dynamic Causal Inference (DCI) performs structured reasoning through dual-pathway perception, dynamic causal graph reasoning across three levels (association, intervention, counterfactual), and evidence audit for final diagnosis; (2) Critic-Driven Graph and Memory Evolution (CGME) iteratively refines the system by storing validated reasoning paths in an exemplar base and consolidating disease-specific knowledge into evolving illness graphs.

We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories.

Using sparse activations and event-driven inferences, SNNs capture temporal dependencies between words, making them suitable for ATE. The proposed architecture, SpikeATE, employs ternary spiking neurons and direct spike training fine-tuned with pseudo-gradients.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly employed for this task, existing approaches predominantly train models to associate events with timestamps in the forward video only. This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs. Specifically, we categorize events into time-sensitive (e.g., putting down a bag) and time-insensitive (e.g., holding a towel in the left hand). The former denote events whose reversal substantially alters their meaning, while the latter remain semantically unchanged under reversal. For time-sensitive events, ArrowGEV introduces a reward that encourages VLMs to discriminate between forward and backward videos, whereas for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArrowGEV not only improves grounding precision and temporal directionality recognition, but also enhances general video understanding and reasoning ability."}

In this paper, we introduce a simple two-hop question answering setting, where answering a question requires making inferences over two multilingual documents. We find that language models are more sensitive to language variation in answer-span documents than in those providing bridging information, despite the equal importance of both documents for answering a question. Under a step-by-step sub-question evaluation, we further show that in up to 33% of multilingual cases, models fail to infer the bridging information in the first step yet still answer the overall question correctly. This indicates that reasoning in language models, especially in multilingual settings, does not follow a faithful step-by-step decomposition. Subsequently, we show that the absence of reasoning decomposition leads to around 18% composition failure, where both sub-questions are answered correctly but fail for the final two-hop questions. To mitigate this, we propose a simple three-stage SUBQ prompting method to guide the multi-step reasoning with sub-questions, which boosts accuracy from 10.1% to 66.5%."}

Preregistered Bayesian regression analyses revealed theory-consistent but small associations between both warmth and competence and audience ratings, while genre-specific interactions did not meaningfully improve predictions. Male protagonists were slightly less warm than female protagonists, and movies with male leads received higher ratings on average (an association that was multiple times stronger than the relationships between movie ratings and warmth/competence). These findings suggest that, although audiences tend to favor warm, competent characters, the effects on movie evaluations are modest, indicating that character personality is only one of many factors shaping movie ratings.

Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training. By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, our work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking new potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine."}

Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data.

However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.\n  This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.\n  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works."}

This practice is computationally expensive and development set intensive, since it repeats training, freezes sparsity, and misses fractional optima. We introduce GRASP LoRA (GRPO Guided Adapter Sparsity Policy), which treats global sparsity as a learnable control variable. A GRPO controller interleaves with training, periodically probing candidate prune ratios on a small micro development set and updating a single global prune ratio online from its reward signal. It operates on merged source and target LoRA adapters on a frozen backbone and replaces grid search with one controller run that learns a prune ratio, followed by a single final merge and prune fine tuning run with pruning fixed to that ratio. On cross lingual transfer from English into Arabic and Chinese, including XL-Sum summarization and MLQA extractive question answering with Llama 3 8B, GRASP LoRA improves semantic faithfulness, content coverage, and answer quality over strong target only and merge and prune baselines.

However, traditional sentiment analysis methods, which focus on individual tasks such as sentiment classification or aspect-based analysis, are not practical for real-world applications that usually require handling multiple tasks. While offering flexibility, LLMs in sentiment-specific tasks often fall short of the required accuracy. Techniques like fine-tuning and evolutionary model merging help integrate models into a unified framework, which can improve the learning performance while reducing computational costs. The use of task meta-data and curriculum learning to optimize learning processes remains underexplored, while sentiment analysis is a critical task in NLP that requires high accuracy and scalability across multiple subtasks. In this study, we propose a hybrid learning model called Multi-stage Evolutionary Model Merging with Meta data driven Curriculum Learning (MEM-MCL), to enhance the sentiment analysis in large language modeling. In particular, expert models are created through instruction tuning for specific sentiment tasks and then merged using evolutionary algorithms to form a unified model. The merging process is optimized with weak data to enhance performance across tasks. The curriculum learning is incorporated to provide a learning sequence based on task difficulty, improving knowledge extraction from LLMs. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MEM-MCL model outperforms conventional LLMs in a majority of sentiment analysis tasks, achieving superior results across various subtasks."}

While effective at boosting accuracy, existing approaches primarily reinforce successful reasoning paths, incurring a substantial calibration cost: models become overconfident and lose the ability to represent uncertainty. This failure has been characterized as a form of model collapse in alignment, where predictive distributions degenerate toward low-variance point estimates. We address this issue by reframing reasoning training as an epistemic learning problem, in which models must learn not only how to reason, but also when their reasoning should be trusted. We propose epistemically-calibrated reasoning (EpiCaR) as a training objective that jointly optimizes reasoning performance and calibration, and instantiate it within an iterative supervised fine-tuning framework using explicit self-evaluation signals. Experiments on Llama-3 and Qwen-3 families demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-superiority over standard baselines in both accuracy and calibration, particularly in models with sufficient reasoning capacity (e.g., 3B+). This framework generalizes effectively to OOD mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and code generation (MBPP). Ultimately, our approach enables a 3X reduction in inference compute, matching the K=30 performance of STaR with only K=10 samples in capable models."}

This provides a concrete functional explanation for the structural redundancy reported in prior studies. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a simple pruning strategy that removes high-BOS sink heads.

In contrast, PRISM allocates sampling density proportional to chormatic diversity. By treating RGB color space as the stratification domain and imposing a maximum capacity k per color bin, the method preserves texture-rich regions with high color variation while substantially reducing visually homogeneous surfaces.

In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency.

Finally, we present MedGround-35K, a novel multimodal medical dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMs trained with MedGround-35K consistently achieve improved referring grounding performance, enhance multi-object semantic disambiguation, and exhibit strong generalization to unseen grounding settings. This work highlights MedGround as a scalable, data-driven approach to anchor medical language to verifiable visual evidence. Dataset and code will be released publicly upon acceptance."}

In this paper, we propose Laser, a novel paradigm that reformulates visual deduction via Dynamic Windowed Alignment Learning (DWAL). Instead of forcing a point-wise prediction, Laser aligns the latent state with a dynamic validity window of future semantics. This mechanism enforces a \"Forest-before-Trees\" cognitive hierarchy, enabling the model to maintain a probabilistic superposition of global features before narrowing down to local details. Crucially, Laser maintains interpretability via decodable trajectories while stabilizing unconstrained learning via Self-Refined Superposition. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks demonstrate that Laser achieves state-of-the-art performance among latent reasoning methods, surpassing the strong baseline Monet by 5.03% on average. Notably, it achieves these gains with extreme efficiency, reducing inference tokens by more than 97%, while demonstrating robust generalization to out-of-distribution domains."}

We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES. Experiments show that MVGGT establishes the first strong baseline and achieves both high accuracy and fast inference, outperforming existing alternatives.

To support this task, we introduce AgentHallu, a comprehensive benchmark with: (1) 693 high-quality trajectories spanning 7 agent frameworks and 5 domains, (2) a hallucination taxonomy organized into 5 categories (Planning, Retrieval, Reasoning, Human-Interaction, and Tool-Use) and 14 sub-categories, and (3) multi-level annotations curated by humans, covering binary labels, hallucination-responsible steps, and causal explanations. We evaluate 13 leading models, and results show the task is challenging even for top-tier models (like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro).

In this paper, we hypothesize and empirically validate that memorization signals are heavily skewed towards the high-entropy initial tokens, where model uncertainty is highest, and decay as context accumulates. To leverage this linguistic property, we introduce Positional Decay Reweighting (PDR), a training-free and plug-and-play framework.

Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network. Thanks to our reference image fusion strategy, we significantly decrease the number of reference images, thus decreasing the time needed to process these images and the memory required to store them. Furthermore, with our lightweight network, our method requires less inference time. Though with fewer reference images, experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that our method achieves comparable results with other methods that require more reference images and larger network parameters."}

Based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs), our approach employs a prompt-based generative paradigm, jointly producing sentiment and explanation. To further enhance aspect-oriented reasoning capabilities, we propose a dependency-syntax-guided sentiment cue strategy. This strategy prunes and textualizes the aspect-centered dependency syntax tree, guiding the model to distinguish different sentiment aspects and enhancing its explainability. To enable explainability, we use MLLMs to construct new datasets with sentiment explanations to fine-tune.

However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset.

However, evaluating bias in LLM outputs remains methodologically challenging due to sensitivity to prompt wording, limited multilingual coverage, and the lack of standardized metrics that enable reliable comparison across models. This paper introduces BiasLab, an open-source, model-agnostic evaluation framework for quantifying output-level (extrinsic) bias through a multilingual, robustness-oriented experimental design. BiasLab constructs mirrored probe pairs under a strict dual-framing scheme: an affirmative assertion favoring Target A and a reverse assertion obtained by deterministic target substitution favoring Target B, while preserving identical linguistic structure. To reduce dependence on prompt templates, BiasLab performs repeated evaluation under randomized instructional wrappers and enforces a fixed-choice Likert response format to maximize comparability across models and languages. Responses are normalized into agreement labels using an LLM-based judge, aligned for polarity consistency across framings, and aggregated into quantitative bias indicators with descriptive statistics including effect sizes and neutrality rates. The framework supports evaluation across diverse bias axes, including demographic, cultural, political, and geopolitical topics, and produces reproducible artifacts such as structured reports and comparative visualizations. BiasLab contributes a standardized methodology for cross-lingual and framing-sensitive bias measurement that complements intrinsic and dataset-based audits, enabling researchers and institutions to benchmark robustness and make better-informed deployment decisions."}

Although recent deep learning approaches leverage diffusion model priors with geometry buffers (G-buffers) to produce visually compelling results without explicit scene geometry or light simulation, they remain constrained by two major limitations. First, the iterative nature of the diffusion process introduces substantial latency. Second, the inherent stochasticity of these generative models compromises physical accuracy and temporal consistency. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel, end-to-end, deterministic, single-step neural rendering framework, RenderFlow, built upon a flow matching paradigm. To further strengthen both rendering quality and generalization, we propose an efficient and effective module for sparse keyframe guidance. Our method significantly accelerates the rendering process and, by optionally incorporating sparsely rendered keyframes as guidance, enhances both the physical plausibility and overall visual quality of the output. The resulting pipeline achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic rendering quality, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of modern generative models and the precision of traditional physically based rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework by introducing a lightweight, adapter-based module that efficiently repurposes the pretrained forward model for the inverse rendering task of intrinsic decomposition."}

PAA leverages in-context learning, using previous paraphrases and their scores to guide candidate generation. Experiments across five ML and NLP conferences with three LLM reviewers and five attacking models show that PAA consistently increases review scores without changing the paper's claims. Human evaluation confirms that generated paraphrases maintain meaning and naturalness. We also find that attacked papers exhibit increased perplexity in reviews, offering a potential detection signal, and that paraphrasing submissions can partially mitigate attacks."}

A Teacher network trained on articulatory phonetic features (via Epitran and PanPhon) produces target embeddings, while a Student network learns to approximate these from raw characters. At inference, only the lightweight Student (1.7M parameters) is required, enabling deployment without runtime phonetic conversion.\n  Training uses a three-phase curriculum on 57 million toponyms from GeoNames, Wikidata, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Phase 1 trains the Teacher on 467K phonetically-grounded triplets. Phase 2 aligns the Student to Teacher outputs across 23M samples, achieving 96.6% cosine similarity. Phase 3 fine-tunes on 3.3M hard negative triplets -- negatives sharing prefix and script with the anchor but referring to different places -- to sharpen discrimination.\n  Evaluation on the MEHDIE Hebrew-Arabic benchmark achieves 89.2% Recall@1, outperforming Levenshtein (81.5%) and Jaro-Winkler (78.5%).

A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \\alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \\alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our findings and the proposed ReFine-RFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks.

Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enables non-invasive tumor characterization, clinical workflows typically acquire only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast agent dose. In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches.

Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible.

This raises a fundamental question: can agents reliably perform interactive tasks that depend on hidden state? We define Private State Interactive Tasks (PSITs), which require agents to generate and maintain hidden information while producing consistent public responses. We show theoretically that any agent restricted to the public conversation history cannot simultaneously preserve secrecy and consistency in PSITs, yielding an impossibility theorem. To empirically validate this limitation, we introduce a self-consistency testing protocol that evaluates whether agents can maintain a hidden secret across forked dialogue branches. Standard chat-based LLMs and retrieval-based memory baselines fail this test regardless of scale, demonstrating that semantic retrieval does not enable true state maintenance. To address this, we propose a novel architecture incorporating an explicit private working memory; we demonstrate that this mechanism restores consistency, establishing private state as a necessary component for interactive language agents."}

Currently, a paramount concern for VQA in this domain is the stringent requirement for fast latency and real-time processing, as delays directly impact real-world safety in this safety-critical application. However, current state-of-the-art VQA models, particularly large vision-language models (VLMs), often prioritize performance over computational efficiency. These models typically process dense patch tokens for every frame, leading to prohibitive computational costs (FLOPs) and significant inference latency, especially with long video sequences.

We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines.

To address this, we introduce MedTutor, a novel system designed to augment resident training by automatically generating evidence-based educational content and multiple-choice questions from clinical case reports. MedTutor leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that takes clinical case reports as input and produces targeted educational materials. The system's architecture features a hybrid retrieval mechanism that synergistically queries a local knowledge base of medical textbooks and academic literature (using PubMed, Semantic Scholar APIs) for the latest related research, ensuring the generated content is both foundationally sound and current. The retrieved evidence is filtered and ordered using a state-of-the-art reranking model and then an LLM generates the final long-form output describing the main educational content regarding the case-report. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of the system. First, three radiologists assessed the quality of outputs, finding them to be of high clinical and educational value. Second, we perform a large scale evaluation using an LLM-as-a Judge to understand if LLMs can be used to evaluate the output of the system.

In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes.

However, multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain and leads existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to reliably remove heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches."}

However, despite advances in story generation, large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to bridge these long-range narrative dependencies, often leaving \"Chekhov's guns\" unfired even when the necessary context is present. Existing evaluations largely overlook this structural failure, focusing on surface-level coherence rather than the logical fulfillment of narrative setups. In this paper, we introduce Codified Foreshadowing-Payoff Generation (CFPG), a novel framework that reframes narrative quality through the lens of payoff realization. Recognizing that LLMs struggle to intuitively grasp the \"triggering mechanism\" of a foreshadowed event, CFPG transforms narrative continuity into a set of executable causal predicates. By mining and encoding Foreshadow-Trigger-Payoff triples from the BookSum corpus, we provide structured supervision that ensures foreshadowed commitments are not only mentioned but also temporally and logically fulfilled. Experiments demonstrate that CFPG significantly outperforms standard prompting baselines in payoff accuracy and narrative alignment. Our findings suggest that explicitly codifying narrative mechanics is essential for moving LLMs from surface-level fluency to genuine narrative competence."}

Existing methods, relying on static fusion or LLMs, face computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations. To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning. Experiments on Weibo, Weibo21, and GossipCop demonstrate that DIVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 2.72\\%, while optimizing inference efficiency with a reduced latency of 4.12 s."}

A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions. A planner that reads the parsed demonstrations, maintains task states, and dynamically formulates the next high-level action plan based on contextual reasoning. An executor that faithfully carries out these action plans at the OS level, performing precise clicks, drags, text inputs, and window operations with safety checks and real-time feedback.

One increasingly popular approach uses task arithmetic to combine models trained on different tasks to create a model for a task where there is little to no training data. In this paper, we consider training on a particular language to be a task, and we generate task vectors by fine-tuning variants of the Whisper ASR system.

In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms."}

We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff.\n  Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required."}

Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bottleneck: demographics explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction and reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values and identity achieve strong alignment with substantially lower bias. These trends generalize to SimBench (441 aligned questions), where SCOPE personas outperform default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas, and SCOPE augmentation improves Nemotron-based personas.

To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak.

While stochastic sampling promotes novelty, it often degrades consistency. Here, we propose ReMIND, a REM-inspired modular framework for ideation. ReMIND consists of four stages: wake, which generates a stable low-temperature semantic baseline; dream, which performs high-temperature exploratory generation; judge, which applies coarse evaluation to filter incoherent outputs and extract candidate ideas; and re-wake, which re-articulates selected ideas into coherent final outputs. By instantiating each stage as an independent LLM, ReMIND enables functional separation between exploration and consolidation. Parameter sweeps show that ReMIND reliably induces semantic exploration while preserving downstream stability. Embedding-based analyses confirm substantial semantic displacement during the dream phase, whereas external evaluations reveal that high-quality ideas emerge sporadically rather than as extrema along any single metric. These results suggest that serendipitous ideation in LLMs is a rare-event process best approached through system level design that shapes the conditions under which valuable ideas can emerge and be stabilized. ReMIND provides a general framework for studying the computational basis of serendipity and illustrates how modular LLM orchestration can bridge exploration and stabilization."}

This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes.

One typical behavior is that they often perform unnecessary verification and revisions even if they have reached the correct answers. This limitation stems from the unstructured nature of reasoning trajectories and the lack of targeted supervision for critical reasoning abilities. To address this, we propose Structured Reasoning (SCR), a framework that decouples reasoning trajectories into explicit, evaluable, and trainable components. We mainly implement SCR using a Generate-Verify-Revise paradigm. Specifically, we construct structured training data and apply Dynamic Termination Supervision to guide the model in deciding when to terminate reasoning. To avoid interference between learning signals for different reasoning abilities, we adopt a progressive two-stage reinforcement learning strategy: the first stage targets initial generation and self-verification, and the second stage focuses on revision. Extensive experiments on three backbone models show that SCR substantially improves reasoning efficiency and self-verification. Besides, compared with existing reasoning paradigms, it reduces output token length by up to 50%."}

This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%)."}

However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a prevailing \\textit{build-then-reason} paradigm, which relies on a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG). This paradigm faces two critical challenges. First, the KG's inherent incompleteness often breaks reasoning paths. Second, the graph's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces distractor facts, presenting query-relevant but misleading knowledge that disrupts the reasoning process.\n  To address these challenges, we argue for a \\textit{reason-and-construct} paradigm and propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. To tackle incompleteness, \\textbf{Relink} instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. To handle misleading or distractor facts, Relink employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting those most useful for answering the query rather than relying on their pre-existence. This empowers Relink to actively discard distractor facts and construct the most faithful and precise evidence path for each query.\n  Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show that Relink achieves significant average improvements of 5.4\\% in EM and 5.2\\% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework."}

In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input.

By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity.

We review linguistic features, such as orthography, morphology, lexical diversity, syntax, information density, and typological distance, linking each to concrete modeling mechanisms.

We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling."}

To address this challenge, we propose ActiShade, which detects and activates overshadowed knowledge to guide large language models (LLMs) in multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, ActiShade iteratively detects the overshadowed keyphrase in the given query, retrieves documents relevant to both the query and the overshadowed keyphrase, and generates a new query based on the retrieved documents to guide the next-round iteration. By supplementing the overshadowed knowledge during the formulation of next-round queries while minimizing the introduction of irrelevant noise, ActiShade reduces the error accumulation caused by knowledge overshadowing.

A fundamental pillar of this trustworthiness is calibration, which refers to an agent's ability to express confidence that reliably reflects its actual performance. While calibration is well-established for static models, its dynamics in tool-integrated agentic workflows remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, revealing a fundamental confidence dichotomy driven by tool type. Specifically, our pilot study identifies that evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to inherent noise in retrieved information, while verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. To robustly improve calibration across tool types, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a holistic benchmark of reward designs. We demonstrate that our trained agents not only achieve superior calibration but also exhibit robust generalization from local training environments to noisy web settings and to distinct domains such as mathematical reasoning. Our results highlight the necessity of domain-specific calibration strategies for tool-use agents. More broadly, this work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty in high-stakes, real-world deployments."}

Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a \"data scale-method-performance\" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the \"Channel-Multi-scale Spatial\" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance.

To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset.

We therefore introduce Mitrasamgraha, a high-quality Sanskrit-to-English machine translation dataset consisting of 391,548 bitext pairs, more than four times larger than the largest previously available Sanskrit dataset Itih=asa. It covers a time period of more than three millennia and a broad range of historical Sanskrit domains. In contrast to web-crawled datasets, the temporal and domain annotation of this dataset enables fine-grained study of domain and time period effects on MT performance. We also release a validation set consisting of 5,587 and a test set consisting of 5,552 post-corrected bitext pairs. We conduct experiments benchmarking commercial and open models on this dataset and fine-tune NLLB and Gemma models on the dataset, showing significant improvements, while still recognizing significant challenges in the translation of complex compounds, philosophical concepts, and multi-layered metaphors. We also analyze how in-context learning on this dataset impacts the performance of commercial models"}

Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence. To enable efficient training while reducing input tokens, we propose the Scene-Primed ASR-anchored Compressor (SPA-Compressor), which compresses multimodal tokens into hierarchical scene and event representations guided by ASR semantic cues.

To investigate the root causes, we conduct systematic experiments on DLLMs and identify three key reasons: 1) entity fragmentation during training, 2) data asymmetry, and 3) missing entity relations. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling (DiffER), which addresses the reversal curse through entity-aware training and balanced data construction. Specifically, DiffER introduces whole-entity masking, which mitigates entity fragmentation by predicting complete entities in a single step. DiffER further employs distribution-symmetric and relation-enhanced data construction strategies to alleviate data asymmetry and missing relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffER effectively alleviates the reversal curse in Diffusion LLMs, offering new perspectives for future research."}

We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks.

Recent advances in speculative decoding have shifted from sequential chain-based drafting to tree-structured generation, where the draft model constructs a tree of candidate tokens to explore multiple possible drafts in parallel. However, existing tree-based SD methods typically build a fixed-width, fixed-depth draft tree, which fails to adapt to the varying difficulty of tokens and contexts. As a result, the draft model cannot dynamically adjust the tree structure to early stop on difficult tokens and extend generation for simple ones. To address these challenges, we introduce TALON, a training-free, budget-driven adaptive tree expansion framework that can be plugged into existing tree-based methods. Unlike static methods, TALON constructs the draft tree iteratively until a fixed token budget is met, using a hybrid expansion strategy that adaptively allocates the node budget to each layer of the draft tree. This framework naturally shapes the draft tree into a \"deep-and-narrow\" form for deterministic contexts and a \"shallow-and-wide\" form for uncertain branches, effectively optimizing the trade-off between exploration width and generation depth under a given budget.

Our results show that, while human observers perform poorly (near chance levels) on this binary classification task, a variety of machine-learning models achieve accuracy in the range 0.93 - 0.98 over a previously unseen test set, even using only short samples and single-token (unigram) features. We therefore employ an inherently interpretable (linear) classifier (with a test accuracy of 0.98), in order to elucidate the underlying reasons for this high accuracy. In our analysis, we identify specific unigram features indicative of LLM-generated text, one of the most important being that the LLM tends to use a larger variety of synonyms, thereby skewing the probability distributions in a manner that is easy to detect for a machine learning classifier, yet very difficult for a human observer. Four additional explanation categories were also identified, namely, temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language usage, and colloquialisms. As identification of the AI-generated text depends on a constellation of such features, the classification appears robust, and therefore not easy to circumvent by malicious actors intent on misrepresenting AI-generated text as human work."}

To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.\n  We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.\n  Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity."}

To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains~(HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone's early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH: 84.2 to 97.0). Finally, Engram establishes infrastructure-aware efficiency: its deterministic addressing enables runtime prefetching from host memory, incurring negligible overhead. We envision conditional memory as an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models."}

Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the functional utility of spatial directives, specifically whether an instruction successfully guides a navigator to the intended destination. Although existing VLN agents could serve as evaluators, their reliance on high-fidelity visual simulators introduces licensing constraints and computational costs, and perception errors further confound linguistic quality assessment. This paper introduces GROKE(Graph-based Reasoning over OSM Knowledge for instruction Evaluation), a vision-free training-free hierarchical LLM-based framework for evaluating navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that structured JSON and textual formats for spatial information substantially outperform grid-based and visual graph representations. Our hierarchical architecture combines sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation, reducing navigation error by 68.5% compared to heuristic and sampling baselines on the Map2Seq dataset. The agent's execution success, trajectory fidelity, and decision patterns serve as proxy metrics for functional navigability given OSM-visible landmarks and topology, establishing a scalable and interpretable evaluation paradigm without visual dependencies.

We developed a foundation model-based AI pipeline for patient-level classification and lesion-level detection of CRLM on contrast-enhanced CT, integrating uncertainty quantification and explainability. CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles. Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases.

However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning."}

Previous work shows that their internal states encode rich signals of truthfulness, yet the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that truthfulness cues arise from two distinct information pathways: (1) a Question-Anchored pathway that depends on question-answer information flow, and (2) an Answer-Anchored pathway that derives self-contained evidence from the generated answer itself. First, we validate and disentangle these pathways through attention knockout and token patching. Afterwards, we uncover notable and intriguing properties of these two mechanisms. Further experiments reveal that (1) the two mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries; and (2) internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Finally, building on these insightful findings, two applications are proposed to enhance hallucination detection performance. Overall, our work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems."}

First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views.

To support deeper modeling of argumentation dialogue, we present the first large-scale \\textbf{S}trategic \\textbf{A}rgumentative \\textbf{D}ialogue dataset, SAD, consisting of 392,822 examples.

Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features. Second, we design a Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) to refine predictions by modeling contextual relationships through a dynamically constructed layout graph. Extensive experiments show PARL achieves state-of-the-art results. It establishes a new benchmark for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and, notably, surpasses even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. Crucially, PARL (65M) is highly efficient, using roughly four times fewer parameters than large multimodal models (256M), demonstrating that sophisticated visual structure modeling can be both more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion."}

Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales. Extensive experiments on eight popular benchmarks across six different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of KALE, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%."}

However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning."}

We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts. Specifically, we replace the reference answer with an incorrect entity and construct diverse pairings of original and swapped references with correspondingly aligned candidate answers. Surprisingly, grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across a broad set of judge models. We empirically show that this vulnerability is driven by judges' over-reliance on parametric knowledge, leading judges to disregard the given reference under conflict. Finally, we find that this failure persists under common prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and motivating reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to the provided reference."}

To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement.

Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness. We show that our latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms."}

The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed among different models, identifying those that strike the optimal balance in each intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings."}

Structured generation, or constrained decoding, addresses this drawback by producing content in standardized formats such as JSON, ensuring consistency and guaranteed-parsable outputs, but it can inadvertently restrict the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs. We further evaluate our approach on several datasets, covering both classification and reasoning tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a substantial gain of up to 27% in accuracy compared to natural generation, while requiring only a small overhead of 10-20 extra tokens."}

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes \"near-miss\" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications."}

To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods.

Towards this goal, we introduce PoT, a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later (e.g., citations and shifts in researchers' agendas). PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human-model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent. By combining time-partitioned, future-verifiable targets with an offline sandbox for tool use, PoT supports scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific idea judgment tasks."}

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities."}

To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art.

With extracted metadata from 14,171 papers across four major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG) over the past six years, we reveal several critical findings: (1) Task Divergence: While Dialogue Generation demonstrates a rapid shift toward LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation remains locked into n-gram metrics, and Question Answering exhibits a substantial decline in the proportion of studies conducting human evaluation. (2) Metric Inertia: Despite the development of semantic metrics, general-purpose metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) continue to be widely used across tasks without empirical justification, often lacking the discriminative power to distinguish between specific quality criteria.

However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \\textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models.

Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction."}

We design a novel question answering task, which is based around the values of geopolitical indicators for various countries over various years. Questions require breaking down into intermediate steps, retrieval of data, and mathematical operations over that data. The meta-level reasoning ability of LLMs is analysed by examining the selection of appropriate tools for answering questions.

By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity.

Our simulator achieves superior profile adherence and behavioral diversity compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, evaluating 7 prominent supporter models with our system uncovers previously obscured performance degradations. These findings underscore the utility of our framework in providing a more faithful and stress-tested evaluation for emotional support chatbots."}

While existing benchmarks have initiated the evaluation of multi-image models, a comprehensive analysis of their core weaknesses and their causes is still lacking. In this work, we introduce MIMIC (Multi-Image Model Insights and Challenges), a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multi-image capabilities of LVLMs. Using MIMIC, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments that reveal pervasive issues: LVLMs often fail to aggregate information across images and struggle to track or attend to multiple concepts simultaneously. To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks.

An experimental comparison of RAG approaches", "comment": null, "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of \"Enhanced\" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as \"Agentic\" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance."}

In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension.

It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM."}

While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story."}

TeleMem further introduces a structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries, substantially improving storage efficiency, reducing token usage, and accelerating memory operations.

After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose Laser, a novel paradigm that reformulates visual deduction via Dynamic Windowed Alignment Learning (DWAL). Instead of forcing a point-wise prediction, Laser aligns the latent state with a dynamic validity window of future semantics. This mechanism enforces a \"Forest-before-Trees\" cognitive hierarchy, enabling the model to maintain a probabilistic superposition of global features before narrowing down to local details. Crucially, Laser maintains interpretability via decodable trajectories while stabilizing unconstrained learning via Self-Refined Superposition. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks demonstrate that Laser achieves state-of-the-art performance among latent reasoning methods, surpassing the strong baseline Monet by 5.03% on average.

Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution."}

We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems."}

When addressees are uncertain about what speakers mean, for example, they can request clarification. It is an open question for language models whether they can assume a similar addressee role, recognizing and expressing their own uncertainty through clarification. We argue that reference games are a good testbed to approach this question as they are controlled, self-contained, and make clarification needs explicit and measurable. To test this, we evaluate three vision-language models comparing a baseline reference resolution task to an experiment where the models are instructed to request clarification when uncertain. The results suggest that even in such simple tasks, models often struggle to recognize internal uncertainty and translate it into adequate clarification behavior. This demonstrates the value of reference games as testbeds for interaction qualities of (vision and) language models."}

In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion.

In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency.
